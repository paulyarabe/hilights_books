nature gets the heart right 99 percent of the time 9 that sounds pretty great until you realize that in the united states the 1 percent of children born with congenital heart defects amounts to forty thousand babies a year 10 blowing a balloon open in a diseased valve was a band aid at best cribier s eventual goal was much loftier he wanted to transform aortic valve replacement from open heart surgery to a minimally invasive procedure by implanting a valve prosthesis within the diseased calcific native valve on the beating heart using catheter based techniques and local anesthesia he faced extensive challenges to be able to even imagine what this might look like but the biggest one had nothing to do with science and technology the negative opinion of experts was definitely the greatest barrier he wrote to me the idea was even considered the most stupid idea ever heard for most of modern times the discovery and initial description of angina was attributed to british physician william heberden 1710 1801 in his very vaguely titled paper some account of disorder of the breast which he presented to the royal college of physicians in london in 1768 it was published in 1772 8 heberden provided an arresting and incredibly accurate description based off an analysis of only twenty patients those who are afflicted with it are seized while they are walking with a painful and most disagreeable sensation in the breast which seems as if it would extinguish life if it were to increase these breathtaking discoveries these complex descriptions of heart disease in all their different forms though would remain unknown for centuries while much of western medicine draws a straight line back to the egyptians in many ways much of what was learned in the cradle of human civilization was lost and many of these conditions such as angina or heart failure would not be discovered until centuries after they had already been recognized it was our inability to comprehend their ancient language that prevented these findings from being transmitted and built upon rather than buried underneath the ruins of time harvey who was incredibly powerful at the time of the publication of his work knew that he was not immune to retribution in de motu cordis he wrote what remains to be said on the quantity and source of this transferred blood is so strange and undreamed of that not only do i fear danger to myself from the malice of a few but i dread lest i have all men as enemies so much does habit or doctrine once absorbed become second nature and so much does reverence for antiquity influence all men any condition that chronically raises the level of inflammation in the body can raise the risk of heart disease this is true as we found in an analysis i published with colleagues even of diseases such as the skin condition psoriasis 24 patients with psoriasis are much more likely to have heart attacks and strokes and this occurs because these patients immune system is always going gangbusters not only causing the angry skin lesions these patients have but leading to atherosclerotic plaque deposition in the blood vessels and eventually causing their rupture as well the history of heart disease like so many others makes it clear that sometimes the biggest impediments in the progress of science are the gatekeepers and opinion leaders of their respective fields yet an expert is by definition wedded to the status quo and as their expertise grows so does their relationship with the existing body of knowledge upon which their authority is recognized in medical science detours from the truth bear a heavy human cost and a century of unchecked hypertension likely led to the deaths of millions upon millions of people from heart attacks and strokes and all this knowledge of the ills of high blood pressure leads us to the most important question of all what can we do to fix it however opposition to cholesterol s causative role in atherosclerosis persisted widely in 1979 sir john mcmichael one of the most prominent british cardiologists of his time in an article in the british medical journal called the recommendation to reduce dietary cholesterol propaganda going on to write that atherosclerosis is a wear and tear disease even the best possible trial could not make up for the fact that the treatments available were just terrible dietary restriction on the other hand while showing promise in some rigorous studies was notoriously ineffective in the real world the cppt had helped push the lipid hypothesis forward but its implications for patients were limited given how difficult taking the medication was it became clear that an advance as distinct as say the iphone was needed such an advance would be produced by a japanese biochemist who was studying fungi in petri dishes trying to find the next blockbuster antibiotic even in his wildest dreams he never could have imagined what he would stumble upon born in 1933 akira endo in his own words grew up in a rural farming family in northern japan and found himself fascinated with molds and mushrooms as a child 22 he dreamed of one day becoming the next alexander fleming fleming 1881 1955 a studious microbiologist was perhaps not the tidiest he was investigating a common bacterium in petri dishes one day when he showed up to his lab a bacterial colony had been destroyed by fungus which had contaminated one of the samples when he cultured that fungus he found that the mold juice that it produced had killed bacteria he called that juice penicillin akira endo joined a japanese pharmaceutical company hoping that one of the molds he was studying would one day help him discover the successor to penicillin when he came to new york for studies in the 1960s there were aspects of american life there he found very alien i was very surprised by the large number of elderly and overweight people and by the rather rich dietary habits he wrote in the residential area of the bronx where i lived there were many elderly couples living by themselves and i often saw ambulances going to take an elderly person who had suffered a heart attack to the hospital 23 endo thought that the same fungi that produced penicillin might also produce substances that could reduce the production of cholesterol which was part of bacteria s cell membrane back in japan his team tested more than 3 800 types of fungi before they hit pay dirt cholesterol is a fundamental ingredient for all living things humans especially cholesterol a critical part of the membrane of each cell is a key ingredient in many hormones and substances such as bile which assist with the absorption of food and are an essential component of the human brain the liver s production of cholesterol was likely necessary when fat was an infrequent component of our diets but now that we have more than our fair share of cholesterol in our everyday foods this production is probably not that necessary endo tested this substance in animals every one of whom except rats showed significant lowering of cholesterol the reason it didn t work in rats was because the enzyme that this drug blocked would rebound after a while in rats only nullifying the beneficial effects endo teamed up with a tokyo based physician and began testing it in humans and early results were very promising and then suddenly everything came to a screeching halt some dogs treated with doses hundreds of times higher than necessary had developed what was thought to be intestinal cancer but was later found to be a noncancerous change occurring in the cells because of the enormous doses being used 24 even as work at endo s company stalled out of an abundance of caution another pharmaceutical company merck developed a similar compound and after finding no signal of risk in their studies continued with the development of their product that product was called lovastatin the first statin drug to ever reach the market in 1987 akira endo had not discovered the next blockbuster antibiotic without knowing it he had discovered perhaps the most important medicine since penicillin statins are so effective that no medication since their development thirty years ago has so far been shown to be better than they are and it is incredibly difficult for any medication to show benefit when it is prescribed to someone already taking a statin when i emailed akira endo who is eighty four years old and retired i never expected to hear back but i did according to him it is clear what the greatest achievement in heart health is i think that cholesterol metabolism and prevention and treatment are the biggest advances on whether he was taking a statin he wrote both my wife and i have taken statins for more than ten years i cannot tell you which one he knew of at least six treatments available but wasn t sure if any of them really worked so he devised an experiment 24 he selected twelve sailors with very similar symptoms all of them had putrid gums the spots and lassitude with weakness of the knees he put them all in one place in the holds and gave them all a similar but terrible diet like water gruel sweetened with sugar for breakfast and fresh mutton broth for dinner he then supposedly at random gave them the treatments he knew of he gave two cider two sulfuric acid two vinegar two seawater two a mixture of nutmeg and garlic and finally gave two lemons and oranges the results were remarkable of the entire group the patients who received lemons and oranges were fit for duty within a week and began nursing the others to health this was for most intents and purposes the first controlled clinical trial performed in human history he described these results in his book a treatise of the scurvy published in 1753 but it took another fifty years for citrus to become the accepted treatment for scurvy james lind s experiment was important because he ensured that all the subjects in the trial were controlled meaning both patients getting the intervention and those getting other therapies were similar bad things happen when experiments are not controlled suppose the patients getting citrus were sicker than those getting seawater who had a milder deficiency in that case the patients receiving the citrus may have fared worse simply because they were sicker to begin with things like consent and humane treatment of subjects were largely seen as hurdles to scientific progress prostitutes in germany were unknowingly infected with syphilis while cancer cells were being injected into patients in new york city 33 many researchers argued that the ends justified the means but henry beecher an anesthesiologist at harvard medical school and one of medicine s most famous whistle blowers argued a study is ethical or not at its inception it does not become ethical merely because it turned up valuable data he went on to ask whoever gave the investigator the godlike right of choosing martyrs with the advent of the controlled trial another frequent ethical slip was the deprivation of treatment to patients in the control arm of trials before a trial is started scientists today are asked to determine if there is scientific equipoise what does that mean well imagine there is a new treatment for dementia and you want to perform a randomized trial for this new treatment what type of treatment will patients in the control arm get is it ethical to withhold the treatment being studied from the patients getting the placebo with dementia given that there are almost no evidence based treatments for it it may be fair to provide no additional treatment to the patients in the control arm the fact is that in medical circles the study was far from secret and reports from it had been published almost fifteen times in medical literature in fact in 1965 a young doctor just out of medical school irwin schatz after reading one of these results in a medical journal wrote a letter to the researchers in charge of the study expressing his outrage i am utterly astounded by the fact that physicians allow patients with a potentially fatal disease to remain untreated when effective therapy is available the fact is that i would rather trust a finding with a p value of 0 06 in a randomized controlled clinical trial than a p value of u003c0 0001 in an observational study if what you seek is truth and if what you abhor is random chance the p value is only one small piece of the puzzle yet that is not how most view this conundrum and changes in medicine and computing are about to make p value fever a whole lot worse the proliferation of numbers has led to the emergence of what has been called data rich information poor drip syndrome personally i have helped lead analyses that included at times hundreds of thousands of patients almost each and every relationship between two different groups of patients within these databases can be statistically significant but totally worthless in real life why with large data sets these days the p value for even the smallest differences can be very low even if the actual difference between the two results is miniscule and meaningless loath as they may be to admit it most doctors and researchers also get most of their information not from scientific conferences or medical journals but from the internet just like everyone else the singular focus that many clinicians have on the magical effects of modern allopathic medicine however can obscure a major aspect of what they do the human aspect a huge contributor to the therapeutic effect of almost everything we prescribe has nothing to do with what s in the pill or what we are doing with stents in someone s heart it has everything to do with how physicians listen to patients how they examine them how they connect with them as human beings and how they respond to their symptoms allay their fears reassure them that they are in the best of hands and that all their concerns will be addressed how can docs help listening to patients stories shockingly helps patients of physicians who are more empathetic are more likely to adhere to the medications they have been prescribed 38 patients of surgeons who provided them not only clear instructions but gave them encouragement have lesser pain and are able to leave the hospital sooner at the turn of the millennium troponins were added to the definition of how heart attacks are defined and this fundamentally changed what even constitutes a heart attack 40 it allowed many patients who clearly were having ongoing damage to the heart to be diagnosed and then treated with either medications and procedures this included people like lucy who if it hadn t been for troponins might never have been diagnosed with a heart attack in fact we know that women s symptoms are more likely to be not taken as seriously as men s yet troponins are far from perfect and in many cases troponins can be elevated in the absence of a heart attack not only that there are conditions where there is extensive breakdown of muscle such as after someone has run a marathon or kidney failure when the body fails to excrete troponins that can cause them to be elevated the cath lab teaches us that the time to act is not when there are no consequences but when inaction is the greatest consequence itself sones was shaken but understood the gravity of what had happened he reached out to others who had inadvertently pushed contrast into coronary arteries but only heard horror stories yet sones was determined to do it right because he understood that being able to actually see what s inside the coronary arteries could be an epochal advance though even he likely didn t foresee what lay ahead years later he wrote in a letter with considerable fear and trepidation we embarked on a program to accomplish the objective instead of using the 40 50 cc of contrast that he had been using for the aorta he used a much smaller dose that adequately filled and opacified the coronary arteries without sending the patient into cardiac standstill getting pregnant has a profound effect on the body including the function of the heart the expansion in blood volume necessitates the heart to beat both harder and faster in the united states even though millions of people have heart failure the number of hearts available for donation is only around three thousand per year and that is only because so many young people have been dying recently because of the opioid epidemic lydia knew that it could be months before she could find a good match almost seventy years on one can argue that the golden age of cardiology is only now being fully realized just a few years ago if lydia had a dead heart in her chest the surgeons might have been calling the morgue but the surgeons didn t pronounce her dead or call her family to arrange for her funeral or perform an autopsy instead they implanted mechanical pumps right into her new heart to whir blood throughout her body despite the odds lydia survived with the mechanical pumps long enough for a third heart to become available for her after a few months this time everything went as planned the heart took to her body like a baby cub takes to her mother lydia is no longer in the hospital she is back in the big country where she was always destined to be left ventricular assist devices lvads haven t just changed how we deal with heart disease they represent the dawn of a new era in human life the union of man and machine and have implications not only for how we treat heart failure but for what it means to be human lvads are mechanical pumps that are surgically implanted into patient s left ventricles the pumping chamber of the heart initially most patients received an lvad while they waited in a hospital in the hope that they would get a heart transplant some got their wish but many others never did just in the past decade twenty thousand patients in the united states have received an lvad 2 these people rarely have a pulse and if you do cpr on their chest they might actually die because of it they have an lvad sewn into their practically vestigial heart to do its work at any moment if these patients batteries discharge they can die yet they aren t stowed away in hospitals they are roaming the streets lifting weights in the gym and shopping on black friday doing many things they were able to do before their hearts gave up on them some of them call themselves lvad warriors and they might represent the future of mankind what makes heart failure such a challenging disease is how difficult it can be to take care of sick heart failure patients at home heart failure in fact is the most common cause of admissions to the hospital for older adults in the united states the heart for all its wonders has one achilles heel heart muscle is very poor at regenerating a heart once damaged can rarely if ever heal therefore even though there are medications and procedures that can prevent the heart s function from potentially worsening there is little that can be done about a heart scarred while heart transplantation can be an option for a few patients it comes with its own set of challenges patients who receive a heart transplant have to take special medications that suppress the immune system these medications prevent the body s immune system from rejecting the foreign heart yet because they dampen the body s immunity this can lead to the person becoming very susceptible to infections both common and obscure that can practically affect any part of the body these medications have to be taken religiously without fail for years and years and not taking them can have disastrous consequences he had a routine ultrasound a few weeks earlier that showed that his heart function was normal but i wanted a second look as soon as the images started being broadcast on the ultrasound machine though that was reduced to a distant memory peter s heart was barely moving it certainly seemed like his body was rejecting his heart i turned toward peter and asked him this time with more than a hint of perturbation if he had been taking his medications he confessed that for the past few weeks he hadn t taken them he told me he couldn t afford them i am sorry he told me over and over again even as i tried to tell him it was okay i gave him a hefty dose of steroids to blast his immune system into submission but he seemed to only be getting worse in 2010 the fda approved the first lvad for destination therapy meaning that the lvad by itself was now the destination the constant companion of the patient until he or she met their eventual end it was this change that helped exponentially increase the number of patients receiving lvads lvads are very effective at improving heart failure yet they come with a serious set of complications lvad patients have very high rates of bleeding since the pumps chew up clotting factors these patients also need to religiously take blood thinners to prevent the formation of blood clots within the pump another complication that can lead to stroke the driveline remains the achilles heel of lvad technology given that it represents a permanent conduit between the sterile inside of the body and the rampaging cacophony of germs in the outside world this leads to a very high risk of infections through several facebook groups such as lvad warriors or lvad friends you will realize that these virtual groups give lvad patients something that neither doctors nor nurses neither family nor friends can give as a fly on the wall in these groups i catch a vivid window into the realms of people whose lives are marked as much by heroic peaks of joy as spiraling depths of despair every member has this sense that they have somehow cheated death that they are alive because of a technology only a few in the world can access and one that didn t exist until just a few years ago lvads let them have babies get married be around for their children s and grandchildren s graduations and so forth when they dress up to go to a party they post pictures letting everyone know they haven t quite given up on life yet all this comes at a toll that can be too much for some to withstand having an lvad requires constant and incessant care of the device the driveline coming out of the skin the dressings used to cover it the batteries that always need to be charged monitoring of the pump at all times to make sure that it is functioning right and on and on and on no one person alone can ever take care of an lvad and having robust social support is a prerequisite to getting an lvad the need for almost 24 7 caregiver support can place a heavy burden on family members many of whom i have seen relocating and changing or leaving jobs having an lvad can make some people feel like they are trapped i sometimes wake up and remember that this is my life and for a second i have to convince myself posted a woman this life isn t for the weak but it s hard to be a warrior every day another woman described walking into a rural hotel bar with her lvad and everyone stopped talking when we got outside i said to my husband that i think these farmers thought i might be wearing a suicide belt or special weapons she wrote if they had asked i would have told them i was from the future some within the same sentence expressed a dueling sense of deep gratitude and gloom the lvad made me feel as if i was half robot lol it is a journey that i would not wish upon my worst enemy yet i am so grateful that this option was there for me you can do this lvad warrior when a patient was depressed asking the group if they could just be truthful and say they all hated their lvad another replied don t fight the vad kick its butt and make it your bitch some people do so well with their lvads that they even give up the opportunity to be listed for a transplant for many patients with lvads the greatest inconvenience is having to wear their batteries around their waist yet one of my senior mentors who has witnessed the transformation of heart failure care with his own eyes put things into perspective for a patient we never thought people would live long enough to complain about the size of the batteries said dr joe rogers to me in clinic one day a very small number of patients with lvads actually do experience something quite unusual recovery of the function of their native hearts the fact is that even as there is such a dramatic focus on treating heart disease the future may be more about making sure a heart never gets diseased to begin with as we have learned once the heart is damaged and muscle turns to scar there is no way back yet not only do we have a myriad of means to minimize the risk of heart disease already available we have reinforcements on the way there are medications called pcsk9 inhibitors now available that can annihilate bad cholesterol in our bodies 25 yet pcsk9 inhibitors can cost tens of thousands of dollars and are unaffordable for the vast majority there are other medications in development that patients only need to take once or twice a year that could serve as a virtual vaccine against atherosclerosis 26 in the next century heart health needs to be viewed as a right rather than a privilege
