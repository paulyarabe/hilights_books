one thing that musk holds in the highest regard is resolve and he respects people who continue on after being told no i would like to die thinking that humanity has a bright future he said if we can solve sustainable energy and be well on our way to becoming a multiplanetary species with a self sustaining civilization on another planet to cope with a worst case scenario happening and extinguishing human consciousness then and here he paused for a moment i think that would be really good i think there are probably too many smart people pursuing internet stuff finance and law musk said on the way that is part of the reason why we haven t seen as much innovation while the putting man on mars talk can strike some people as loopy it gave musk a unique rallying cry for his companies it s the sweeping goal that forms a unifying principle over everything he does employees at all three companies are well aware of this and well aware that they re trying to achieve the impossible day in and day out when musk sets unrealistic goals verbally abuses employees and works them to the bone it s understood to be on some level part of the mars agenda what musk has developed that so many of the entrepreneurs in silicon valley lack is a meaningful worldview he s the possessed genius on the grandest quest anyone has ever concocted he s less a ceo chasing riches than a general marshaling troops to secure victory i noted how impressive it was for so many people to turn up on a saturday musk saw the situation in a different light complaining that fewer and fewer people had been working weekends of late we ve grown fucking soft musk replied i was just going to send out an e mail we re fucking soft of the really tough things is figuring out what questions to ask musk said once you figure out the question then the answer is relatively easy i came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask the teenage musk then arrived at his ultralogical mission statement the only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment the most striking part of elon s character as a young boy was his compulsion to read from a very young age he seemed to have a book in his hands at all times it was not unusual for him to read ten hours a day as the years went on the cousins took their entrepreneurial pursuits more seriously even attempting at one point to start a video arcade without any parents knowing the boys picked out a spot for their arcade got a lease and started navigating the permit process for their business eventually they had to get someone over eighteen to sign a legal document and neither the rives father nor errol would oblige when elon gets into something he develops just this different level of interest in it than other people that is what differentiates elon from the rest of humanity rocket science gave musk a flavor for what silicon valley had to offer both from a talent and culture perspective there were people working at the office twenty four hours a day and they didn t think it at all odd that musk would turn up around 5 p m every evening to start his second job we brought him in to write some very menial low level code said peter barrett an australian engineer who helped start the company he was completely unflappable after a short while i don t think anyone was giving him any direction and he ended up making what he wanted to make musk never seemed to leave the office he slept not unlike a dog on a beanbag next to his desk almost every day i d come in at seven thirty or eight a m and he d be asleep right there on that bag heilman said maybe he showered on the weekends i don t know musk asked those first employees of zip2 to give him a kick when they arrived and he d wake up and get back to work while musk did his possessed coder thing kimbal became the rah rah sales leader kimbal was the eternal optimist and he was very very uplifting the big problem of course was that no one was buying week after week heilman knocked on doors and returned to the office with very little to report in the way of good news the nicest responses came from the people who told heilman that advertising on the internet sounded like the dumbest thing they had ever heard of most often the shop owners just told heilman to leave and stop bothering them when lunchtime came around the musks would reach into a cigar box where they kept some cash take heilman out and get the depressing status reports on the sales what kept the employees spirits up were the continuous improvements musk made with the zip2 software the service had morphed from a proof of concept to an actual product that could be used and demoed ever marketing savvy the musk brothers tried to make their web service seem more important by giving it an imposing physical body musk built a huge case around a standard pc and lugged the unit onto a base with wheels when prospective investors would come by musk would put on a show and roll this massive machine out so that it appeared like zip2 ran inside of a mini supercomputer the investors thought that was impressive kimbal said heilman also noticed that the investors bought into musk s slavish devotion to the company even then as essentially a college kid with zits elon had this drive that this thing whatever it was had to get done and that if he didn t do it he d miss his shot while musk had exceled as a self taught coder his skills weren t nearly as polished as those of the new hires they took one look at zip2 s code and began rewriting the vast majority of the software musk bristled at some of their changes but the computer scientists needed just a fraction of the lines of code that musk used to get their jobs done they had a knack for dividing software projects into chunks that could be altered and refined whereas musk fell into the classic self taught coder trap of writing what developers call hairballs big monolithic hunks of code that could go berserk for mysterious reasons the engineers also brought a more refined working structure and realistic deadlines to the engineering group this was a welcome change from musk s approach which had been to set overly optimistic deadlines and then try to get engineers to work nonstop for days on end to meet the goals if you asked elon how long it would take to do something there was never anything in his mind that would take more than an hour ambras said we came to interpret an hour as really taking a day or two musk for the first time would be confronting a deep pocketed entrenched industry head on with the hopes of upending all of the incumbents musk also began to hone his trademark style of entering an ultracomplex business and not letting the fact that he knew very little about the industry s nuances bother him in the slightest he had an inkling that the bankers were doing finance all wrong and that he could run the business better than everyone else the race to win internet payments gave musk a chance to show off his quick thinking and work ethic he kept devising plans to counter the advantage paypal had established on auction sites like ebay and he rallied the x com employees to implement the tactics as fast as possible using brute force appeals to their competitive natures there really wasn t anything suave about him ankenbrandt said we all worked twenty hours a day and he worked twenty three hours musk passed his laptop over to griffin and cantrell and they were dumbfounded the document detailed the costs of the materials needed to build assemble and launch a rocket according to musk s calculations he could undercut existing launch companies by building a modest sized rocket that would cater to a part of the market that specialized in carrying smaller satellites and research payloads to space the spreadsheet also laid out the hypothetical performance characteristics of the rocket in fairly impressive detail i said elon where did you get this cantrell said musk had spent months studying the aerospace industry and the physics behind it from cantrell and others he d borrowed rocket propulsion elements fundamentals of astrodynamics and aerothermodynamics of gas turbine and rocket propulsion along with several more seminal texts forget the mice forget the plant with its own video feed growing or possibly dying on mars musk would inspire people to think about exploring space again by making it cheaper to explore space bowing to his nature musk set an insanely ambitious timeline for all of this one of the earliest spacex presentations suggested that the company would complete its first engine in may 2003 a second engine in june the body of the rocket in july and have everything assembled in august a launchpad would then be prepared by september and the first launch would take place in november 2003 or about fifteen months after the company started a trip to mars was naturally slated for somewhere near the end of the decade this was musk the logical na ve optimist tabulating how long it should take people physically to perform all of this work as space enthusiasts started to learn about the new company they didn t really obsess over whether musk s delivery schedule sounded realistic or not they were just thrilled that someone had decided to take the cheap and fast approach a ground up internal development increases difficulty and the required investment but no other path will achieve the needed improvement in the cost of access to space what musk would not tolerate were excuses or the lack of a clear plan of attack hollman was one of many engineers who arrived at this realization after facing one of musk s trademark grillings the worst call was the first one hollman said something had gone wrong and elon asked me how long it would take to be operational again and i didn t have an immediate answer he said you need to this is important to the company everything is riding on this why don t you have an answer he kept hitting me with pointed direct questions i thought it was more important to let him know quickly what happened but i learned it was more important to have all the information musk decided to unveil a prototype of falcon 1 to the public in december 2003 the company would haul the seven story high falcon 1 across the country on a specially built rig and leave it and the spacex mobile launch system outside of the federal aviation administration s headquarters in washington d c an accompanying press conference would make it clear to washington that a modern smarter cheaper rocket maker had arrived this marketing song and dance didn t sound sensible to spacex s engineers they were working more than one hundred hours per week to make the actual rocket that spacex would need to be in business musk wanted them to do that and build a slick looking mock up in elon s mind it would get us a lot of backing from important people in the government he vented about this in the factory one night unaware that musk stood nearby and could hear everything two hours later mary beth brown appeared with an appointment card to see a lasik eye surgery specialist when hollman visited the doctor he discovered that musk had already agreed to pay for the surgery elon can be very demanding but he ll make sure the obstacles in your way are removed hollman said upon reflection he also warmed to the long term thinking behind musk s washington plan i think he wanted to add an element of realism to spacex and if you park a rocket in someone s front yard it s hard to deny it hollman said the event in washington ended up being well received and just a few weeks after it took place spacex made another astonishing announcement despite not having even flown a rocket yet spacex revealed plans for a second rocket many good engineers who everyone beside management felt were assets to the company were forced out or simply fired outright after being blamed for things they hadn t done the kiss of death was proving elon wrong about something 2004 the engines were burning consistently and meeting all their requirements this meant that mueller and his team could breathe easy and that everyone else at spacex should prepare to suffer mueller had spent spacex s entire existence as the critical path the person holding up the company from achieving its next steps working under musk s scrutiny with the engine ready it was time for mass panic mueller said no one else knew what it was like to be on critical path lots of people soon found out as major problems abounded the avionics which included the electronics for the navigation communication and overall management of the rocket turned into a nightmare seemingly trivial things like getting a flash storage drive to talk to the rocket s main computer failed for undetectable reasons the software needed to manage the rocket also became a major burden it s like anything else where you find out that the last ten percent is where all the integration happens and things don t play together mueller said this process went on for six months the dash to the united states and back showed that spacex s thirty person team had real pluck in the face of adversity and inspired everyone on the island a traditional three hundred person strong aerospace launch crew would never have tried to fix a rocket like that on the fly it is perhaps worth noting that those launch companies that succeeded also took their lumps along the way musk wrote in a postmortem a friend of mine wrote to remind me that only 5 of the first 9 pegasus launches succeeded 3 of 5 for ariane 9 of 20 for atlas 9 of 21 for soyuz and 9 of 18 for proton having experienced firsthand how hard it is to reach orbit i have a lot of respect for those that persevered to produce the vehicles that are mainstays of space launch today musk closed the letter writing spacex is in this for the long haul and come hell or high water we are going to make this work blast by blast the engineers learned a great deal about the inner workings of the batteries they developed methods for arranging them in ways that would prevent fires spreading from one battery to the next and other techniques for stopping explosions altogether thousands of batteries exploded along the way and the effort was worth it it was still early days for sure but tesla was on the verge of inventing battery technology that would set it apart from rivals for years to come and would become one of the company s great advantages we were all working ourselves to the point of exhaustion said david vespremi a former tesla spokesman then came this profound moment where we were reminded that building the car was not about getting to an ipo or selling it to a bunch of rich dudes but because it might change what a car is these victories though were not enough to overcome the feeling shared by many of the tesla engineers that eberhard had reached the end of his abilities as a ceo the company veterans had always admired eberhard s engineering smarts and continued to do so eberhard in fact had turned tesla into a cult of engineering regrettably other parts of the company had been neglected and people doubted eberhard s ability to take the company from the r u0026d stage to production the days of people being ambiguous about the roadster s manufacturing costs were gone as well elon got fired up and said we were going to do this intense cost down program said popple he gave a speech saying we would work on saturdays and sundays and sleep under desks until it got done someone pushed back from the table and argued that everyone had been working so hard just to get the car done and they were ready for a break and to see their families elon said i would tell those people they will get to see their families a lot when we go bankrupt i was like wow but i got it i had come out of a military culture and you just have to make your objective happen employees were required to meet at 7 a m every thursday morning for bill of materials updates they had to know the price of every part and have a cogent plan for getting parts cheaper if the motor cost 6 500 a pop at the end of december musk wanted it to cost 3 800 by april the costs were plotted and analyzed each month if you started falling behind there was hell to pay popple said everyone could see it and people lost their jobs when they didn t deliver elon has a mind that s a bit like a calculator if you put a number on the projector that does not make sense he will spot it he doesn t miss details popple found musk s style aggressive but he liked that musk would listen to a well argued analytical point and often change his mind if given a good enough reason some people thought elon was too tough or hot tempered or tyrannical popple said but these were hard times and those of us close to the operational realities of the company knew it i appreciated that he didn t sugarcoat things
