as he started into his speech i realized that the words he spoke would not be as powerful as the image of him an african american standing on these stages this was the gift and the struggle of working for obama obama was unique in that the mere fact of his own identity was going to leave an imprint on people abroad in addition to being the american president he was a symbol for the aspirations of billions of people particularly ethnic minorities in the developed world and young people in the developing world it s why we carved out time for him to engage populations who wouldn t normally meet an american president playing soccer in a favela in brazil meeting dalits in india or visiting a refugee center in malaysia it s why we established programs for him to engage young people particularly in the two regions most associated with his background africa and southeast asia and it s one reason why he focused so much on the words that he spoke abroad we re telling a story he told me early that first year about who we are why don t i just give this to you you can fill in the others with that he proceeded to pace slowly around the oval office for nearly an hour pausing every so often over the pad on his desk dictating his outline within it he had embedded a series of policy decisions and how he wanted them framed about how to categorize detainees at gitmo about how to balance transparency and secrecy in government when he was finished he told me to scrub it with the rest of the staff and get him a draft in a few days and so i had the awkward responsibility as essentially a midlevel staffer of calling a meeting the following day with the senior white house staff so that i could tell them what the president wanted to do as i was working on this speech it became clear to me how agencies form their own antibodies against a president s desire to move in a particular direction as one muslim colleague said to me the phrase radical islam is heard by many muslims as a characterization of islam itself and not of a faction within it meanwhile the polling that had been done showed that what most muslims actually cared about was poverty corruption and unemployment if you asked them what they wanted to work with america on the answers were education and entrepreneurship science and technology if you asked them what u s policy was focused on they said oil israel and weakening the muslim world years later after obama left office i ran into a palestinian born woman whom i knew casually she said she d never forgotten the cairo speech which she connected to the initial protests of the arab spring i said that that was assigning too much responsibility to a speech it wasn t the speech she said it was him the young people saw him a black man as president of america someone who looked like them and they thought why not me as would often be the case he vented about things that he could not really change the structural dynamic in washington that sees politics as a game and foreign policy as an extension of politics he sat next to me on the couch and began to talk not so much about the speech but about the kind of president he wanted to be the american people are idealists he said but their leaders have to be realistic and hard headed at the beginning and end of the speech he wanted to draw upon american idealism roosevelt s belief that we carry special burdens in the world in between he wanted to acknowledge that in disorderly places there is a limit to what we can achieve another time at a meeting on what he was aiming to accomplish in his first term i pointed to the potential for a democratic opening in burma ben he said no one cares about burma in ohio these comments stuck with me for the first time i felt out of step with my boss in the quiet of my empty apartment i began to wrestle with bigger questions how would i see myself in five years if i couldn t remember what i was like five years ago how do you establish your own voice when your entire reputation is founded on someone else s how much can you compromise your own positions in service of a larger good before you sacrifice them i felt we had gradually trimmed our sails and lowered our sights i looked increasingly for smaller things that i could work on if i had outlets on issues where i could make a difference it could add a layer to my experience at work separate from the grind of politics and the intractability of some of the larger issues on our agenda obama would practice an answer and then we d critique his performance get into it faster look at the person who asked the question don t forget your home base at some point obama who liked to name the absurdities of politics snapped i get it he said so this isn t really a debate at all it s just a performance he asked that we just write up the best answers he could give on key questions drawing on the best answers he gave in debate prep afterward as the flight to cambodia gained altitude obama came to see me that was worth doing he said he looked out the window it s interesting how the place feels frozen in time it reminds me of what jakarta looked like when i lived there now it s just high rises they d be smart to preserve some of what makes this part of the world different i also argued that if we were going to intervene in syria s civil war we should do so with our own military from central america to afghanistan america didn t have a great track record with arming proxies if we thought it was worth tipping the balance against assad we should be debating whether to strike his regime directly i pressed this point in a few meetings in late 2012 and early 2013 but i was usually the only person doing so other than jake and samantha in one meeting early in the second term obama went around the room as he normally did when he wanted to test the status quo of his policies jake and i were sitting together on the back bench and when it got to us we made versions of the same argument if things keep deteriorating i said we should consider bombing assad s runways or we should consider limited strikes against some regime infrastructure southeast asia became the other region i took on as it pulled together the different threads of what interested me the most in our foreign policy the burden of history and the wars in vietnam cambodia and laos the strategic importance of a region that was increasingly important to our position vis vis china an essential part of any effort to combat climate change a sprawling place populated by people of different religions and ethnicities a place of opportunity we know that like south africa the united states had to overcome centuries of racial subjugation as was true here it took sacrifice the sacrifice of countless people known and unknown to see the dawn of a new day michelle and i are beneficiaries of that struggle over 30 years ago while still a student i learned of nelson mandela and the struggles taking place in this beautiful land and it stirred something in me it woke me up to my responsibilities to others and to myself and it set me on an improbable journey that finds me here today and while i will always fall short of madiba s example he makes me want to be a better man technological progress without an equivalent progress in human institutions can doom us the scientific revolution that led to the splitting of an atom requires a moral revolution as well we went in ordered some food took pictures with the staff and then she left he said i ended up shaking every hand in there most of the folks in these places have been watching fox news and think i m the antichrist but if you show up shake their hand and look them in the eye it s harder for them to turn you into a caricature you might even pick up a few votes he talked about what it took to win the presidency to win he told us you have to have a core reason why you re running and you need to make it clear to everyone how much you want to win you have to want it he said like michael jordan demanding the ball in the final moments of a game
