this prospect created an even greater new stratagem for development opportunities mammoth housing complexes would have to be constructed for these laborers as would shopping malls hospitals fire and police department facilities water and sewage treatment plants electrical communications and transportation networks in fact the end result would be to create modern cities where once only deserts had existed here too was the opportunity to explore emerging technologies in for example desalinization plants microwave systems health care complexes and computer technologies saudi arabia was a planner s dream come true and also a fantasy realized for anyone associated with the engineering and construction business it presented an economic opportunity unrivaled by any in history an economically developing country with virtually unlimited financial resources and a desire to enter the modern age in a big way very quickly i simply put my imagination to work and wrote reports that envisioned a glorious future for the kingdom i had rule of thumb numbers i could use to estimate such things as the approximate cost to produce a megawatt of electricity a mile of road or adequate water sewage housing food and public services for one laborer i was not supposed to refine these estimates or draw final conclusions my job was simply to describe a series of plans more accurately perhaps visions of what might be possible and to arrive at rough estimates of the costs associated with them i always kept in mind the true objectives maximizing payouts to us firms and making saudi arabia increasingly dependent on the united states it did not take long to realize how closely the two went together almost all the newly developed projects would require continual upgrading and servicing and they were so highly technical as to assure that the companies that originally developed them would have to maintain and modernize them began to assemble two lists for each of the projects i envisioned one for the types of design and construction contracts we could expect and another for long term service and management agreements main bechtel brown u0026 root halliburton stone u0026 webster and many other us engineers and contractors would profit handsomely for decades to come beyond the purely economic there was another twist that would render saudi arabia dependent on us though in a very different way the modernization of this oil rich kingdom would trigger adverse reactions for instance conservative muslims would be furious israel and other neighboring countries would feel threatened the economic development of this nation was likely to spawn the growth of another industry protecting the arabian peninsula private companies specializing in such activities as well as the us military and defense industry could expect generous contracts and once again long term service and management agreements their presence would require another phase of engineering and construction projects including airports missile sites personnel bases and all of the infrastructure associated with such facilities i have found that people warm to you very quickly if you open your eyes ears and heart to their culture i ll be frank paula said one day while we were sitting in a coffee shop the indians and all the farmers who live along the river you re damming hate you even people in the cities who aren t directly affected sympathize with the guerrillas who ve been attacking your construction camp your government calls these people communists terrorists and narcotics traffickers but the truth is they re just people with families who live on lands your company is destroying it isn t about changing the mechanics of economics it is about changing the ideas the dogmas that have driven economics for centuries debt and fear insufficiency divide and conquer it is about moving from ideas about merely being sustainable to ones that include regenerating areas devastated by agriculture mining and other destructive activities it is about revolution the transition from a death economy to a life economy is truly about a change in consciousness a consciousness revolution the marketplace is a democracy if we choose to use it as such that every time we buy something we cast a vote when you must shop buy locally as well as at consignment and thrift stores make things last buy goods and services from and invest in businesses that are committed to making a better world no one is perfect so seek out the ones that are doing the best in their field 3 live consciously focus on doing things that enhance your relationship with other people your community and the world around you including honoring nature in whatever form it takes in your locale break old patterns that revolve around materialism and buying stuff downsize your house car and wardrobe bicycle or take public transportation avoid activities that use fossil fuels give talks at local schools libraries and other forums
