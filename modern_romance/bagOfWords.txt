between 2005 and 2012 more than one third of couples who got married in the us met through an online dating site online dating was the single biggest way people met their spouses bigger than work friends and school combined 5 literally hundreds of unread solicitations as she scrolled and scrolled through message after message the guys in the audience looked on in horror they couldn t believe the sheer volume of it all the woman said she felt bad that a lot of the messages would probably just be deleted because she would never have time to respond to them all the men in the audience collectively let out a pained groan throughout all our interviews this was a consistent finding in online dating women get a ton more attention than men the images that resulted in the most conversation showed people doing interesting things sometimes faces didn t even need to appear a guy giving a thumbs up while scuba diving a woman standing in a barren desert a woman playing a guitar these photos revealed something deeper about their interests or their lives and led to more meaningful interaction near the end of 2014 tinder claimed that the average user logged on eleven times per day and spent approximately seven minutes on each session meaning they are there for more than 1 25 hours each day that s an amazing amount of time to do anything let alone move your fingers around a tiny screen at certain times though this i need the best mentality can be debilitating i wish i could just eat somewhere that looks good and be happy with my choice but i can t the problem is that i know somewhere there is a perfect meal for me and i have to do however much research i can to find it that s the thing about the internet it doesn t simply help us find the best thing out there it has helped to produce the idea that there is a best thing and if we search hard enough we can find it and in turn there are a whole bunch of inferior things that we d be foolish to choose if this mentality has so pervaded our decision making then it stands to reason that it is also affecting our search for a romantic partner especially if it s going to be long term in a sense it already has remember we are no longer the generation of the good enough marriage we are now looking for our soul mates and even after we find our soul mates if we start feeling unhappy we get divorcedn nbe careful of soul mate job not necessary schwartz s research and a considerable amount of scholarship from other social scientists too shows that when we have more options we are actually less satisfied and sometimes even have a harder time making a choice at all on average the maximizers put much more time and effort into their job search they did more research asked more friends for advice and went on more interviews in return the maximizers in the study got better jobs they received on average a 20 percent higher starting salary than the satisficers after they started their jobs though schwartz and his colleagues asked the participants how satisfied they were what they found was amazing even though the maximizers had better jobs than the satisficers by every psychological measure they felt worse about them overall maximizers had less job satisfaction and were less certain they d selected the right job at all the satisficers by contrast were generally more positive about their jobs the search process and their lives in general the satisficers had jobs that paid less money but they somehow felt better about themn nagain the grow engine should take this into account many young people are showing a lack of interest in romance and also again i love ramen the number of men and women between eighteen and thirty four who are not involved in any romantic relationship with the opposite sex has risen since 1987 from 49 percent to 61 percent for men and from 39 percent to 49 percent for women a whopping one third of japanese people under thirty have never dated 4 and in a survey of those between thirty five and thirty nine more than a quarter reported that they d never had sex 5 okay that was the last whopping i ll use almost half of japanese men and one third of women in their early thirties were still single as of 2005 6 japan s birthrate ranks 222nd out of 224 countries 8 a report compiled with the government s cooperation two years ago warned that by 2060 the number of japanese will have fallen from 127 million to about 87 million of whom almost 40 percent will be sixty five or older 9 japanese prime minister shinzo abe allocated 25 million in the 2014 fiscal budget for programs designed to get people to pair off and have babies including government funded dating services an official survey conducted in 2010 showed that 66 percent of all prefecture governments and 33 percent of city ward town village governments were implementing some form of marriage support even more do so today 10 saga prefecture has set up a department of connection that fixes up singles who want to meet new people and both shizuoka and akita prefectures now provide internet communication services for singles whom they inform about varous parties and events some of which are supported by the government finally fukui prefecture recently launched an online dating site called the fukui marriage hunting caf and couples who meet on the site and marry receive cash and gifts surveys suggest that about 60 percent of male singles in their twenties and thirties in japan identify themselves as herbivores 13 in the first group we held one of the first to arrive was akira a good looking young japanese dude in a really sharp suit akira thirty looked like he was probably doing well for himself he seemed like a successful confident young man this guy wasn t an herbivore right we did interviews and focus groups with singles on four continents and in most of them we broke the ice by asking people to tell us how many people they d asked out or flirted with on their smartphones in the past few weeks when we asked akira that question he just shrugged pretty much all it s charai kinda sleazy in a playboy way to try to pick up a woman you don t know but also if a girl said yes to me i wouldn t want to go out with her i don t like girls who would want to be with a guy openly like that looking smiling winking i want a girl who s seiso pure but it has to be someone with the right background with the right family if it was someone i just met somewhere i d be too embarrassed to tell my parents they d be disappointed i asked the women about the herbivore men and whether they wished guys would take more initiative it was a resounding yes these women yearned for the men in japan to step up and just ask them out from their perspective the men s extreme need for assurance and comfort from the women was irritating men s confidence and sense of self is tied to their professional success everyone we talked to in tokyo seemed to recall the booming eighties as a different era for romance with salarymen flush with cash who could confidently approach a pretty woman and ask for her number without fear this too is probably an exaggeration but a telling one with career jobs now gone it s not only harder for men to meet a partner but also harder for them to support her financially so it makes sense that insecurity might leave men feeling more scared of rejection nearly 50 percent of the single guys in japan don t even have friends of the opposite sex 14 dating online requires self promotion a dating profile is a kind of advertisement a way of marketing yourself to prospective partners but this attitude doesn t really fit well with japanese culture n nexcept in shukatsu but maybe not even then hmm al a young expat originally from baltimore tried to explain the motivations it s like i m lonely i m scared of people he said i need to vent or just have a drink with someone who will listen to me and not judge me they re paying for the security they re paying not to be rejected as i hit thirty i started to despise the bar scene i had experienced every single version of those nights i knew all the possible outcomes and i knew the probabilities of those outcomes when you hit that point you realize how fruitless trying to find love by barhopping can be you have enough data to know that statistically the smartest thing for you to do when you walk into a bar is go to the bathroom jerk off and leave some of the greatest joys of life come from nurturing and from what s called generativity people have strong strivings to build something to do something to leave something behind and of course having children is one way of doing that my own experience having children was that i discovered there were rooms in my heart that i didn t even know were there and if i had committed to a life of repeated sexual flings i never would have opened those doors
