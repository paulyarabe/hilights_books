The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him. --Leo Tolstoy, 1897\n\nMay 31, 2016
All of them enjoyed, immensely, the idea of running money with Steve Eisman. Working for Eisman, you never felt you were working for Eisman. He\u0027d teach you but he wouldn\u0027t supervise you. Eisman also put a fine point on the absurdity they saw everywhere around them. \"Steve\u0027s fun to take to any Wall Street meeting,\" said Vinny. \"Because he\u0027ll say \u0027explain that to me\u0027 thirty different times. Or \u0027could you\n\nMay 31, 2016
explain that more, in English?\u0027 Because once you do that, there\u0027s a few things you learn. For a start, you figure out if they even know what they\u0027re talking about. And a lot of times they don\u0027t!\"\n\nMay 31, 2016
Formalized as an approach to financial markets during the Great Depression by Benjamin Graham, \"value investing\" required a tireless search for companies so unfashionable or misunderstood that they could be bought for less than their liquidation value.\n\nJune 2, 2016
\"If you are going to be a great investor, you have to fit the style to who you are,\" Burry said. \"At one point I recognized that Warren Buffett, though he had every advantage in learning\n\nJune 2, 2016
from Ben Graham, did not copy Ben Graham, but rather set out on his own path, and ran money his way, by his own rules.... I also immediately internalized the idea that no school could teach someone how to be a great investor. If it were true, it\u0027d be the most popular school in the world, with an impossibly high tuition. So it must not be true.\"\n\nJune 2, 2016
Investing was something you had to learn how to do on your own, in your own peculiar way\n\nJune 2, 2016
An afternoon can fly by or it can take 5 hours. Like you probably do, I productively fill the gaps that most people leave as dead time. My drive to be productive probably cost me my first marriage and a few days ago almost cost me my fiancee. Before I went to college the military had this \"we do more before 9am than most people do all day\" and I used to think and I do more than the military. As you know there are some select people that just find a drive in certain activities that supersedes EVERYTHING else.\n\nJune 2, 2016

Back in 1995, Munger had given a talk at Harvard Business School called \"The Psychology of Human Misjudgment.\" If you wanted to predict how people would behave, Munger said, you only had to look at their incentives.\n\nIncentives...matter\n\nJune 2, 2016
Thus when Mike Burry went into business he made sure that he had the proper incentives. He disapproved of the typical hedge fund manager\u0027s deal. Taking 2 percent of assets off the top, as most did, meant the hedge fund manager got paid simply for amassing vast amounts of other people\u0027s money. Scion Capital charged investors only its actual expenses--which typically ran well below 1 percent of the assets. To make the first nickel for himself, he had to make investors\u0027 money grow\n\nJune 2, 2016

Mike Burry found places to invest money shrewdly. He used no leverage and avoided shorting stocks. He was doing nothing more promising than buying common stocks and nothing more complicated than sitting in a room reading financial statements. For roughly $100 a year he became a subscriber to 10-K Wizard. Scion Capital\u0027s decision-making apparatus consisted of one guy in a room, with the door closed and the shades drawn, poring over publicly available information and data\n\nJune 2, 2016
He went looking for court rulings, deal completions, or government regulatory changes--anything that might change the value of a company. Often as not, he turned up what he called \"ick\" investments. In October 2001, he explained the concept in his letter to investors: \"Ick investing means taking a special analytical interest in stocks that inspire a first reaction of \u0027ick.\u0027\" The alarmingly named Avant! Corporation was a good example. He\u0027d found it searching for the word \"accepted\" in news stories. He knew that, standing on the edge of the playing field, he needed to find unorthodox ways to tilt it to his advantage, and that usually meant finding unusual situations the world might not be fully aware of. \"I wasn\u0027t searching for a news report of a scam or fraud per se,\" he said. \"That would have been too backward-looking, and I was looking to get in front of something. I was looking for something happening in the courts that might lead to an investment thesis. An argument being\n\nJune 2, 2016

It goes up by ten times but first it goes down by half.\"\n\nJune 2, 2016
This isn\u0027t the sort of ride most investors enjoy, but it was, Burry thought, the essence of value investing. His job was to disagree loudly with popular sentiment. He couldn\u0027t do this if he was at the mercy of very short-term market moves, and so he didn\u0027t give his investors the ability to remove their money on short notice, as most hedge funds did. If you gave Scion your money to invest, you were stuck for at least a year. Burry also designed his fund to attract people who wanted to be long the stock market--who wanted to bet on stocks going up rather than stocks going down. \"I am not a short at heart,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t dig into companies looking to short them, generally. I want the upside to be much more than the downside, fundamentally.\" He also didn\u0027t like the idea of taking the risk of selling a stock short, as the risk was, theoretically, unlimited. It could only fall to zero, but it could rise to infinity\n\nJune 2, 2016
Want to borrow $1,000,000 for just $25 a month? Quicken Loans has now introduced an interest only adjustable rate mortgage that gives borrowers six months with both zero payments and a 0.03% interest rate, no doubt in support of that wholesome slice of Americana--the home buyer with the short term cash flow problem.\"\n\nJune 2, 2016

Their stint in the private equity business--in which firms buy and sell entire companies over the counter--led them to believe that private stock markets might be more efficient than public ones. \"In private transactions,\" said Charlie, \"you usually have an advisor on both sides that\u0027s sophisticated. You don\u0027t have people who just fundamentally don\u0027t know what something\u0027s worth\n\nJune 2, 2016
\"I don\u0027t think the problem is specific to finance. I think that parochialism is common to modern intellectual life. There is no attempt to integrate.\" The financial markets paid a lot of people extremely well for narrow expertise and a few people, poorly, for the big, global views you needed to have if you were to allocate capital across markets.\n\nJune 2, 2016
This was yet another consequence of turning Wall Street partnerships into public corporations: It turned them into objects of speculation. It was no longer the social and economic relevance of a bank that rendered it too big to fail, but the number of side bets that had been made upon it.\n\nJune 2, 2016
