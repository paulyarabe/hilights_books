nothing makes a man come to grips more directly with his conscience than the presidency the burden of his responsibility literally opens up his soul no longer can he accept matters as given no longer can he write off hopes and needs as impossible lyndon b johnson back of the writhing yelling cruel eyed demons who break destroy maim and lynch and burn at the stake is a knot large or small of normal human beings and these human beings at heart are desperately afraid of something of what of many things but usually of losing their jobs being declassed degraded or actually disgraced of losing their hopes their savings their plans for their children of the actual pangs of hunger of dirt of crime w e b du bois black reconstruction in america 1935 what is the american soul the dominant feature of that soul the air we breathe or to shift the metaphor the controlling vision is a belief in the proposition as jefferson put in the declaration that all men are created equal it is therefore incumbent on us from generation to generation to create a sphere in which we can live live freely and pursue happiness to the best of our abilities we cannot guarantee equal outcomes but we must do all we can to ensure equal opportunity franklin d roosevelt observed during the 1932 campaign the presidency is not merely an administrative office that s the least of it it is more than an engineering job efficient or inefficient it is pre eminently a place of moral leadership all our great presidents were leaders of thought at times when certain historic ideas in the life of the nation had to be clarified the office was a crucible of character in that house of decision the white house a man becomes his commitments johnson said he understands who he really is he learns what he genuinely wants to be douglass understood history and the men who made it perfection was impossible greatness was reserved for those who managed to move forward in an imperfect world his great mission was to accomplish two things first to save his country from dismemberment and ruin and second to free his country from the great crime of slavery to do one or the other or both he must have the earnest sympathy and the powerful cooperation of his loyal fellow countrymen had he put the abolition of slavery before the salvation of the union he would have inevitably driven from him a powerful class of the american people and rendered resistance to rebellion impossible viewed from the genuine abolition ground mr lincoln seemed tardy cold dull and indifferent but measuring him by the sentiment of his country a sentiment he was bound as a statesman to consult he was swift zealous radical and determined wilson also discussed the ideal role the president could play his position takes the imagination of the country he said he is the representative of no constituency but of the whole people when he speaks in his true character he speaks for no special interest if he rightly interpret the national thought and boldly insist upon it he is irresistible and the country never feels the zest of action so much as when its president is of such insight and caliber eisenhower who beneath his serene surface had more than a bit of a temper would reply now look i happen to know a little about leadership i ve had to work with a lot of nations for that matter at odds with each other and i tell you this you do not lead by hitting people over the head any damn fool can do that but it s usually called assault not leadership i ll tell you what leadership is it s persuasion and conciliation and education and patience it s long slow tough work that s the only kind of leadership i know or believe in or will practice i was damn fool enough to lose my temper and to point them to the door wilson remarked after the trotter meeting what i ought to have done would have been to have listened restrained my resentment and when they had finished to have said to them that of course their petition would receive consideration they would have withdrawn quietly and no more would have been heard about the matter but i lost my temper and played the fool the country needs and unless i mistake its temper the country demands bold persistent experimentation roosevelt said in 1932 it is common sense to take a method and try it if it fails admit it frankly and try another but above all try something we need enthusiasm imagination and the ability to face facts even unpleasant ones bravely it s a great realization because we know it s true what so many people believed about him and what made them love him the president never let them down that s what you and i can remember oh we all know he could be exasperating and he could seem to be temporizing and delaying and he d get us all worked up when we thought he was making too many concessions to expediency but all of that was in the little things the unimportant things and he knew exactly how little and how unimportant they really were but in the big things all of the things that were of real permanent importance he never let the people down roosevelt left the draft of a speech he had been scheduled to deliver on saturday april 13 1945 on the occasion of the birthday of thomas jefferson today science has brought all the different quarters of the globe so close together that it is impossible to isolate them one from another roosevelt was to have said today we are faced with the preeminent fact that if civilization is to survive we must cultivate the science of human relationships the ability of all peoples of all kinds to live together and work together in the same world at peace the only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today let us move forward with strong and active faith a senator would come to kennedy and say i d love to go along with you mr president but it would give me serious trouble back home kennedy would always say i understand now johnson knew damn well the senator was going to tell him that and he never let the senator get to the point of his troubles back home he would tell him about the flag and by god the story of the country and he d get them by the lapels and they were out the door that s why he got so much done so fast roosevelt would do that too he would do it let s say with more charm than johnson but they d get the same results they d get what they wanted i made my position unmistakably clear we are not prepared to compromise in any way johnson recalled so far as this administration is concerned i told a press conference its position is firm i wanted absolutely no room for bargaining i knew that the slightest wavering on my part would give hope to the opposition s strategy of amending the bill to death the president would not bend dick you ve got to get out of my way johnson told russell if you don t i m going to roll over you i don t intend to cavil or compromise a phrase johnson had also used on the night of the assassination you may do that russell said but it s going to cost you the south and cost you the 1964 presidential election if that s the price i have to pay johnson said i ll pay it gladly write me the goddamndest toughest voting rights act that you can devise johnson told nicholas katzenbach of the justice department he made the same point to hubert humphrey who would soon become johnson s vice president he used to tell me yes yes hubert i want all those other things buses restaurants all of that but the right to vote with no ifs ands or buts that s the key humphrey recalled of johnson when the negroes get that they ll have every politician north and south east and west kissing their ass begging for their support on the 1964 bill johnson had risen to the the key thing lbj believed was to make the moral case for racial justice so self evident that the country could not help but agree then a man is put in the position almost where he s a bigot to be against the president johnson told sorensen this aura this thing this halo around the president everybody wants to believe in the president and the commander in chief major civil rights progress was possible johnson said and only the president could successfully press the message i have spoken from milwaukee to chicago to new york to los angeles to illinois last night and gettysburg and dallas and johnson city texas and i think that i know one thing that the negroes are tired of this patient stuff and tired of this piecemeal stuff and what they want more than anything else is not an executive order or legislation they want a moral commitment that he s behind them i ve been in north carolina this year i ve been into florida johnson said neither place would they allow negroes to come i said i m going to come and i m going to talk about their constitutional rights and i want them on the platform with me and if you don t let them i m not coming period by god they put them on both places right on the platform and eating with us and eating with us johnson was thinking about the uses of tr s bully pulpit returning to his argument for presidential leadership the president is the cannon you let him be on all the tv networks just speaking from his conscience not at a rally in harlem but at a place in mississippi or texas or louisiana and just have the honor guard there with a few negroes in it then let him reach over and point and say i have to order these boys into battle in the foxholes carrying that flag i don t ask them what their name is whether it s gomez or smith or what color they got what religion if i can order them into battle i ve got to make it possible for them to eat and sleep in this country then everybody goes home and asks his wife what s wrong with this and they go to searching their conscience every preacher starts preaching about it we ought to recognize that and keep them busy the issue of equal rights for american negroes is such an issue and should we defeat every enemy should we double our wealth and conquer the stars and still be unequal to this issue then we will have failed as a people and as a nation for with a country as with a person what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul it is difficult to fight for freedom johnson said as he signed the voting rights act of 1965 in august but i also know how difficult it can be to bend long years of habit and custom to grant it there is no room for injustice anywhere in the american mansion but there is always room for understanding toward those who see the old ways crumbling and to them today i say simply this it must come it is right that it should come in that last sunday sermon in washington in 1968 king spoke of america and of her obligations to whom much is given the scriptures tell us much is expected of individuals and of nations one day we will have to stand before the god of history and we will talk in terms of things we ve done king preached yes we will be able to say we built gargantuan bridges to span the seas we built gigantic buildings to kiss the skies yes we made our submarines to penetrate oceanic depths we brought into being many other things with our scientific and technological power king continued it seems that i can hear the god of history saying that was not enough but i was hungry and ye fed me not i was naked and ye clothed me not i was devoid of a decent sanitary house to live in and ye provided no shelter for me and consequently you cannot enter the kingdom of greatness if ye do it unto the least of these my brethren ye do it unto me that s the question facing america today the magnitude of the job dwarfs every man who aspires to it johnson recalled in his memoirs every man who occupies the position has to strain to the utmost of his ability to fill it i believe that every man who ever occupied it within his inner self was humble enough to realize that no living mortal has ever possessed all the required qualifications the job of the president is to set priorities for the nation and he must set them according to his own judgment and his own conscience if the presidency can be said to have been employed and to have been enjoyed i had employed it to the utmost and i had enjoyed it to the limit back at center stage if only for a moment johnson said let s try to get our folks reasoning together and reasoning with congress and with the cabinet reason with the leadership and with the president and you don t need to start off by saying he is terrible because he doesn t think he s terrible start talking about how you believe that he wants to do what s right and how you believe this is right and you ll be surprised how many who want to do what s right will try to help you great leaders we have had but we could not have had great leaders unless they had a great people to follow you cannot be a great leader unless the people are great eleanor roosevelt when we condemn posterity for slavery or for native american removal or for denying women their full role in the life of the nation we ought to pause and think what injustices are we perpetuating even now that will one day face the harshest of verdicts by those who come after us one of the points of reflecting on the past is to prepare us for action in the present the battle begins with political engagement itself theodore roosevelt put it best the first duty of an american citizen then is that he shall work in politics his second duty is that he shall do that work in a practical manner and his third is that it shall be done in accord with the highest principles of honor and justice those who disdain the arena are unilaterally disarming themselves in the great contests of the soul for they are cutting themselves off childishly from what oliver wendell holmes jr called the passion and action of the age politicians will disappoint that s inevitable but they will also from time to time thrill every man who has been in practical politics tr remarked grows to realize that politicians big and little are no more all of them bad than they are all of them good one need not become a candidate though that s certainly an option worth considering or a political addict hooked on every twist and every turn and every tweet but the paying of attention the expressing of opinion and the casting of ballots are foundational to living up to the obligations of citizenship in a republic
