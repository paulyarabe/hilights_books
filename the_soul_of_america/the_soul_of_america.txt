Nothing makes a man come to grips more directly with his conscience than the Presidency….The burden of his responsibility literally opens up his soul. No longer can he accept matters as given; no longer can he write off hopes and needs as impossible. —L YNDON B . J OHNSON\n\nApril 14, 2019
Back of the writhing, yelling, cruel-eyed demons who break, destroy, maim and lynch and burn at the stake, is a knot, large or small, of normal human beings, and these human beings at heart are desperately afraid of something. Of what? Of many things, but usually of losing their jobs, being declassed, degraded, or actually disgraced; of losing their hopes, their savings, their plans for their children; of the actual pangs of hunger, of dirt, of crime. —W . E . B . D U B OIS, Black Reconstruction in America, 1935\n\nApril 14, 2019
What is the American soul? The dominant feature of that soul—the air we breathe, or, to shift the metaphor, the controlling vision—is a belief in the proposition, as Jefferson put in the Declaration, that all men are created equal. It is therefore incumbent on us, from generation to generation, to create a sphere in which we can live, live freely, and pursue happiness to the best of our abilities. We cannot guarantee equal outcomes, but we must do all we can to ensure equal opportunity.\n\nApril 15, 2019
Franklin D. Roosevelt observed during the 1932 campaign, “ The Presidency is not merely an administrative office. That’s the least of it. It is more than an engineering job, efficient or\n\nApril 15, 2019
inefficient. It is pre-eminently a place of moral leadership. All our great Presidents were leaders of thought at times when certain historic ideas in the life of the nation had to be clarified.”\n\nApril 15, 2019
The office was a crucible of character. “In that house of decision, the White House, a man becomes his commitments,” Johnson said. “He understands who he really is. He learns what\n\nApril 15, 2019
he genuinely wants to be.”\n\nApril 15, 2019
Douglass understood history and the men who made it. Perfection was impossible; greatness was reserved for those who managed to move forward in an imperfect world: His great mission was to accomplish two things: first, to save his country from dismemberment and ruin; and, second, to free his country from the great crime of slavery. To do one or the other, or both, he must have the earnest sympathy and the powerful cooperation of his loyal fellow-countrymen….Had he put the abolition of slavery before the salvation of the Union, he would have inevitably driven from him a powerful class of the American people and rendered resistance to rebellion impossible. Viewed from the genuine abolition ground, Mr. Lincoln seemed tardy, cold, dull, and indifferent; but measuring him by the sentiment of his country, a sentiment he was bound as a statesman to consult, he was swift, zealous, radical, and determined….\n\nApril 17, 2019
Wilson also discussed the ideal role the president could play. “ His position takes the imagination of the country,” he said. “He is\n\nApril 17, 2019
the representative of no constituency, but of the whole people. When he speaks in his true character, he speaks for no special interest. If he rightly interpret the national thought and boldly insist upon it, he is irresistible; and the country never feels the zest of action so much as when its President is of such insight and caliber.”\n\nApril 17, 2019
Eisenhower—who, beneath his serene surface, had more than a bit of a temper—would reply: “ Now, look, I happen to know a little about leadership. I’ve had to work with a lot of nations, for that matter, at odds with each other. And I tell you this: you do not lead by hitting people over the head. Any damn fool can do that, but it’s usually called ‘assault’—not ‘leadership.’…I’ll tell you what leadership\n\nApril 17, 2019
is. It’s persuasion—and conciliation—and education—and patience. It’s long, slow, tough work. That’s the only kind of leadership I know—or believe in—or will practice.”\n\nApril 17, 2019
“ I was damn fool enough to lose my temper and to point them to the door,” Wilson remarked after the Trotter meeting. “What I ought to have done would have been to have listened, restrained my resentment, and, when they had finished, to have said to them that, of course, their petition would receive consideration. They would have withdrawn quietly and no more would have been heard about the matter. But I lost my temper and played the fool.”\n\nApril 20, 2019
“ The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation,” Roosevelt said in 1932. “It is common sense to take a method and try it: If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something….We need enthusiasm, imagination and the ability to face facts, even unpleasant ones, bravely.”\n\nApril 22, 2019
It’s a great realization. Because we know it’s true what so many people believed about him and what made them love him. The President never let them down. That’s what you and I can remember. Oh, we all know he could be exasperating, and he could seem to be temporizing and delaying, and he’d get us all worked up when we thought he was making too many concessions to expediency. But all of that was in the little things, the unimportant things—and he knew exactly how little and how unimportant they really were. But in the big things—all of the things that were of real, permanent importance—he never let the people down.\n\nApril 22, 2019
Roosevelt left the draft of a speech he had been scheduled to deliver on Saturday, April 13, 1945, on the occasion of the birthday of Thomas Jefferson. “ Today, science has brought all the different quarters of the globe so close together that it is impossible to isolate them one from another,” Roosevelt was to have said. “Today we are faced with the preeminent fact that, if civilization is to survive, we must cultivate the science of human relationships—the ability of all peoples, of all kinds, to live together and work together, in the same world, at peace….The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today. Let us move forward with strong and active faith.”\n\nApril 23, 2019
A senator would come to Kennedy and say, “I’d love to go along with you, Mr. President, but it would give me serious trouble back home.” Kennedy would always say, “I understand.” Now Johnson knew damn well the senator was going to tell him that, and he never let the senator get to the point of his troubles back home. He would tell him about the flag, and by God, the story of the country, and he’d get them by the lapels and they were out the door. That’s why he got so much done so fast. Roosevelt would do that, too. He would do it, let’s say, with more charm than Johnson, but they’d get the same results. They’d get what they wanted.\n\nApril 27, 2019
“ I made my position unmistakably clear: We are not prepared to compromise in any way,” Johnson recalled. “ ‘So far as this administration is concerned,’ I told a press conference, ‘its position is firm.’ I wanted absolutely no room for bargaining….I knew that the slightest wavering on my part would give hope to the opposition’s strategy of amending the bill to death.” The president would not bend. “Dick, you’ve got to get out of my way,” Johnson told Russell. “If you don’t, I’m going to roll over you. I don’t intend to cavil or compromise”—a phrase Johnson had also used on the night of the assassination. “You may do that,” Russell said. “But it’s going to cost you the South, and cost you the [1964 presidential] election.” “If that’s the price I have to pay,” Johnson said, “I’ll pay it gladly.”\n\nApril 27, 2019
write me the goddamndest, toughest voting rights act that you can devise,” Johnson told Nicholas Katzenbach of the Justice Department. He made the same point to Hubert Humphrey, who would soon become Johnson’s vice president. “ He used to tell me, ‘Yes, yes, Hubert, I want all those other things—buses, restaurants, all of that—but the right to vote with no ifs, ands, or buts, that’s the key,” Humphrey recalled of Johnson. “ ‘When the Negroes get that, they’ll have every politician, north and south, east and west, kissing their ass, begging for their support.’ ” On the 1964 bill, Johnson had risen to the\n\nApril 27, 2019
The key thing, LBJ believed, was to make the moral case for racial justice so self-evident that the country could not help but agree. “ Then a man is put in the position almost where he’s a bigot to be against the president,” Johnson told Sorensen. “ This aura, this thing, this halo around the President, everybody wants to believe in the President and the Commander in Chief…\n\nApril 27, 2019
Major civil rights progress was possible, Johnson said, and only the president could successfully press the message.\n\nApril 27, 2019
“I have spoken from Milwaukee to Chicago to New York to Los Angeles to Illinois last night, and Gettysburg and Dallas, and Johnson City, Texas, and I think that I know one thing, that the Negroes are tired of this patient stuff and tired of this piecemeal stuff and what they want more than anything else is not an executive order or legislation, they want a moral commitment that he’s behind them.”\n\nApril 27, 2019
“ I’ve been in North Carolina this year….I’ve been into Florida,” Johnson said. “Neither place would they allow Negroes to come. I said, ‘I’m going to come and I’m going to talk about their constitutional rights and I want them on the platform with me, and if you don’t let them I’m not coming, period.’ By God, they put them on both places, right on the platform and…eating with us.”\n\nApril 27, 2019
and…eating with us.” Johnson was thinking about the uses of TR’s “bully pulpit,” returning to his argument for presidential leadership: The President is the cannon. You let him be on all the TV networks just speaking from his conscience, not at a\n\nApril 27, 2019
rally in Harlem, but at a place in Mississippi, or Texas or Louisiana and just have the honor guard there with a few Negroes in it. Then let him reach over and point and say, “I have to order these boys into battle, in the foxholes carrying that flag. I don’t ask them what their name is, whether it’s Gomez or Smith, or what color they got, what religion. If I can order them into battle I’ve got to make it possible for them to eat and sleep in this country.” Then…everybody…goes home and asks his wife, “What’s wrong with this?” and they go to searching their conscience. Every preacher starts preaching about it. We ought to recognize that and [keep] them busy.\n\nApril 27, 2019
The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue. And should we defeat every enemy, should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation. For with a country as with a person, “What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?”\n\nApril 27, 2019
“ It is difficult to fight for freedom,” Johnson said as he signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in August. “But I also know how difficult it can be to bend long years of habit and custom to grant it. There is no room for injustice anywhere in the American mansion. But there is always room for understanding toward those who see the old ways crumbling. And to them today I say simply this: It must come. It is right that it should come.”\n\nApril 27, 2019
In that last Sunday sermon in Washington in 1968, King spoke of America, and of her obligations. To whom much is given, the scriptures tell us, much is expected—of individuals and of nations. “ One day we will have to stand before the God of history and we will talk in terms of things we’ve done,” King preached. “Yes, we will be able to say we built gargantuan bridges to span the seas, we built gigantic buildings to kiss the skies. Yes, we made our submarines to penetrate oceanic depths. We brought into being many other things with our scientific and technological power.”\n\nApril 27, 2019
King continued: “ It seems that I can hear the God of history saying, ‘That was not enough! But I was hungry, and ye fed me not. I was naked, and ye clothed me not. I was devoid of a decent sanitary house to live in, and ye provided no shelter for me. And consequently, you cannot enter the kingdom of greatness. If ye do it unto the least of these, my brethren, ye do it unto me.’ That’s the question facing America today.”\n\nApril 27, 2019
“ The magnitude of the job dwarfs every man who aspires to it,” Johnson recalled in his memoirs. “Every man who occupies the position has to strain to the utmost of his ability to fill it. I believe that every man who ever occupied it, within his inner self, was humble enough to realize that no living mortal has ever possessed all the required\n\nApril 27, 2019
qualifications.”\n\nApril 27, 2019
The job of the President is to set priorities for the nation, and he must set them according to his own judgment and his own conscience….If the Presidency can be said to have been employed and to have been enjoyed, I had employed it to the utmost, and I had enjoyed it to the limit.”\n\nApril 27, 2019
Back at center stage, if only for a moment, Johnson said, “ Let’s try to get our folks reasoning together and reasoning with Congress and with the Cabinet! Reason with the leadership and with the President!…And you don’t need to start off by saying he is terrible—because he doesn’t think he’s terrible. Start talking about how you believe that he wants to do what’s right and how you believe this is right, and you’ll be surprised how many who want to do what’s right will try to help you.”\n\nApril 27, 2019
Great leaders we have had, but we could not have had great leaders unless they had a great people to follow. You cannot be a great leader unless the people are great. —E LEANOR R OOSEVELT\n\nApril 27, 2019
When we condemn posterity for slavery, or for Native American removal, or for denying women their full role in the life of the nation, we ought to pause and think: What injustices are we perpetuating even now that will one day face the harshest of verdicts by those who come after us? One of the points of reflecting on the past is to prepare us for action in the present.\n\nApril 27, 2019
The battle begins with political engagement itself. Theodore Roosevelt put it best: “ The\n\nApril 27, 2019
first duty of an American citizen, then, is that he shall work in politics; his second duty is that he shall do that work in a practical manner; and his third is that it shall be done in accord with the highest principles of honor and justice.” Those who disdain the arena are unilaterally disarming themselves in the great contests of the soul, for they are cutting themselves off, childishly, from what Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., called the “passion and action” of the age. Politicians will disappoint; that’s inevitable. But they will also, from time to time, thrill. “ Every man who has been in practical politics,” TR remarked, “grows to realize that politicians, big and little, are no more all of them bad than they are all of them good.” One need not become a candidate (though that’s certainly an option worth considering) or a political addict hooked on every twist and every turn and every tweet. But the paying of attention, the expressing of opinion, and the casting of ballots are foundational to living up to the obligations of citizenship in a republic.\n\nApril 27, 2019
