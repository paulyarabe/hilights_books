this is about what we did what we saw what we suffered in a thirty four day campaign in the ia drang valley of the central highlands of south vietnam in november 1965 when we were young and confident and patriotic and our countrymen knew little and cared less about our sacrifices this is a love story told in our own words and by our own actions we were the children of the 1950s and we went where we were sent because we loved our country we were draftees most of us but we were proud of the opportunity to serve that country just as our fathers had served in world war ii and our older brothers in korea we were members of an elite experimental combat division trained in the new art of airmobile warfare at the behest of president john f kennedy another and far more transcendent love came to us unbidden on the battlefields as it does on every battlefield in every war man has ever fought we discovered in that depressing hellish place where death was our constant companion that we loved each other we killed for each other we died for each other and we wept for each other and in time we came to love each other as brothers in battle our world shrank to the man on our left and the man on our right and the enemy all around we held each other s lives in our hands and we learned to share our fears our hopes our dreams as readily as we shared what little else good came our way only first place trophies will be displayed accepted or presented in this battalion second place in our line of work is defeat of the unit on the battlefield and death for the individual in combat no fat troops or officers decision making will be decentralized push the power down it pays off in wartime loyalty flows down as well i check up on everything i am available day or night to talk with any officer of this battalion captain john d herren the commander of bravo company herren a pipe smoking twenty nine year old bachelor was an army brat his father was an army lieutenant general and a graduate of west point class of 1958 he was calm thoughtful friendly and steady no one ever saw john herren get flustered once i had taken command my goal was to create the absolute best air assault infantry battalion in the world and the proudest every man in the battalion had to know and believe he was an important part of that best we trained and tested senior military officials from throughout the u s army and allied forces were frequent visitors to fort benning the word had gone out that something new different and deadly in the art of warfare was being created here there was one bit of sobering reality that i insisted be introduced at every level in this training we would declare a platoon leader dead and let his sergeant take over and carry out the mission or declare a sergeant dead and have one of his pfcs take over running the squad we were training for war and leaders are killed in battle i wanted every man trained for and capable of taking over the job of the man above him in the american civil war it was a matter of principle that a good officer rode his horse as little as possible there were sound reasons for this if you are riding and your soldiers are marching how can you judge how tired they are how thirsty how heavy their packs weigh on their shoulders i applied the same philosophy in vietnam where every battalion commander had his own command and control helicopter some commanders used their helicopter as their personal mount i never believed in that you had to get on the ground with your troops to see and hear what was happening you have to soak up firsthand information for your instincts to operate accurately besides it s too easy to be crisp cool and detached at 1 500 feet too easy to demand the impossible of your troops too easy to make mistakes that are fatal only to those souls far below in the mud the blood and the confusion i was tempted to join nadal s or edwards s men but resisted the temptation i had no business getting involved with the actions of only one company i might get pinned down and become simply another rifleman my duty was to lead riflemen when i felt a firm hand on my right shoulder it was sergeant major plumley s he shouted over the racket of the firefights sir if you don t find some cover you re going to go down and if you go down we all go down plumley was right as always anyone waving yelling hand signaling or talking on a radio was instantly targeted by the enemy these guys were quick to spot and shoot leaders radio operators and medics i had never fretted about being wounded in combat in korea or here but plumley brought me up short the game was just beginning this was no time for me to go out of it by now eight men of the platoon s twenty nine had been killed in action another thirteen were wounded the twenty five yard wide perimeter was a circle of pain death fear and raw courage medic charlie lose crawled from man to man throughout the raging firefight doing his best to patch the wounded with the limited supplies in his medical pack although he was wounded twice himself lose never slowed his pace he would keep all thirteen of the wounded alive for twenty six long harrowing hours lose says on several occasions i had to stand or sit up to treat the wounded each time the vc fired heavily at me lose used his 45 and an m 16 rifle to help defend his patients someone brought up a load of ammo for the machine guns beck says that made me very happy there was no one on my left for a long time it was lonely as hell up there until a captain came over to me from my left rear and ordered me to stay put you are with such and such a company now i ll never forget that i can t remember what company he said hell one company s as good as another i don t know what the hell s happening i m out there by myself i m only a twenty year old kid i don t know what s going on i followed russell adams i m his assistant gunner so i go where he goes that s how i got up there before i landed at plei me i had decided that colonel moore needed ammunition more than he needed additional manpower at this point my plan was to change helicopters then two of us loaded with ammo would go back to x ray get the ammo in and bring out the wounded i felt we could reach the lz if we came in hard at treetop level if we couldn t get back out at least the ammo would be there and the infantry would protect us if we could just reach the landing zone when we hit the ground at plei me we were met by medics and the infantry troops still waiting to be lifted into x ray they removed the dead and wounded from my bird and this act is engraved in my mind deeper than any other experience in my two tours in vietnam a huge black enlisted man clad only in g i shorts and boots hands bigger than dinner plates reached into my helicopter to pick up one of the dead white soldiers he had tears streaming down his face and he tenderly cradled that dead soldier to his chest as he walked slowly from the aircraft to the medical station i never knew if the man he picked up was his buddy or not i suspect not his grief was for a fallen comrade and for the agony that violent death brings to those who witness it the infantry radio channel sounded like an old war movie colonel moore trojan 6 came across calm and commanding his voice rang with courage and sound judgment it made men of boys in x ray that day understand your situation keep steady we are going to drop artillery all around you get your men all of them and walk together slowly back as the shells impact just walk back with the artillery and you will be ok hang in there our huey skimmed the trees and headed north out of harm s way i lit up a cigarette turned to my left an dover my shoulder saw a very bloody trooper laid out with his head in another trooper s lap i passed the cigarette back lit another and stuck it in the bloody trooper s mouth at that moment the trooper with the bloody back looked me squarely in the eyes and gave me one of the most cherished thank you s i have ever received a commander in battle has three means of influencing the action fire support now pouring down in torrents his personal presence on the battlefield and the use of his reserve the scriptures say that there is no greater love than to lay down your life for your friends this is what calvin bouknight did in that fire filled jungle he sheltered the wounded he was treating with his own body his back to the enemy guns completely vulnerable deal was helping in the evacuation of casualties when he was brought up short by a strange sight it was at this time that one of the things i regret most about that battle occurred i saw a line not a column just a line of men probably two hundred strong moving on my right flank in the same direction as we were about to turn the east and move in with our casualties i immediately lifted my weapon had them in my sights with a clear shot i started to call for those near me to get their weapons up because i thought they were north vietnamese but it was just a little bit too far to distinguish if they were americans or north vietnamese so i elected not to fire there was also fear of drawing attention to our depleted platoon my men were now all killed or wounded except for the equivalent of two squads about eighteen or so left these two hundred troops were parallel to us making their way to the landing zone marm who had been on my right had already withdrawn it turned out that they were some of the north vietnamese we had to fight later that day who inflicted fearsome casualties on us i only regret that we didn t stand there and start shooting them there are only three principles of warfare audacity audacity and audacity general george s patton sergeant sam hollman jr a native pennsylvanian knelt beside his mortally wounded buddy jack gell and heard him gasp tell my wife i love her suddenly twenty five yards away deal saw an american get up and charge forward while everyone around him was flat on his belly says deal i saw him throw a grenade behind an anthill and empty his weapon into it then he fell to his knees i said to myself get up don t be hurt i didn t know who it was i couldn t make out the form there was so much battlefield haze dust smoke it was lieutenant joe marm he had spotted an enemy machine gun dug into a big termite hill it was chewing up both the bravo company platoons after failing to knock it out with a law rocket and a thrown grenade he decided to deal with it directly he charged through the fire tossed a hand grenade behind the hill and then cleaned up the survivors with his m 16 rifle the following day lieutenant al devney found a dead north vietnamese officer and eleven enemy soldiers sprawled behind that termite mound says deal joe marm saved my life and the lives of many others lieutenant marm suffered a bullet wound to his neck and jaw staff sergeant les staley thirty eight of pike county kentucky ran out and with a private got the wounded lieutenant to his feet supporting him they joined a growing stream of walking wounded flowing back toward the battalion aid station sergeant keeton treated marm s wound and one of bruce crandalfs hueys evacuated him to the rear within days lieutenant joe marm was recuperating at valley forge army hospital near his home in pennsylvania the men i talked with realized that we were facing a fierce determined enemy but he had failed to break through our lines they knew the fight wasn t over i heard weary soldiers say things like we ll get sir and they won t get through us sir their fighting spirit had not dimmed and they made me proud and humble in every one of my companies that had landed in this place this morning there were fifteen to twenty soldiers who had less than two weeks left to go in the army some of those men now lay dead wrapped in ponchos near my command post the rest of them were on that perimeter standing shoulder to shoulder with their buddies ready to continue the fight i had concluded that the american people had a right to know what their sons were doing in this war on the ground in the field i welcomed visiting reporters to my battalion and later to my brigade i told them they could go anywhere they wanted with my troopers with only two restrictions don t put out any information that will endanger us and don t interfere with operations i never had cause to regret that openness a brave captain is as a root out of which as branches the courage of his soldiers cloth spring sir phillip sidney the sergeant came up to me and said you boys must have put up a hell of a fight i said it wasn t us the credit belongs to them i pointed toward some of the american dead the men of charlie company 1st battalion 7th cavalry there is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory but boys it is all hell william tecumseh sfc clarence w blount of pensacola florida was chief of a firing section in captain davis s battery almost twenty years later he wrote me i remember you and sergeant major plumley came to our gun position and you gave our entire unit a fine speech for the great artillery support that we provided during the battle at x ray that speech made a lasting impression on me i felt that my usefulness to my country the army and my unit was really at its peak at that time i have been wanting to say that to someone for a long time
