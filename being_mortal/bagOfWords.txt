in the united states 25 percent of all medicare spending is for the 5 percent of patients who are in their final year of life and most of that money goes for care in their last couple of months that is of little apparent benefit the united states is often thought to be unusual in this regard but it doesn t appear to be data from elsewhere are more limited but where they are available for instance from countries like the netherlands and switzerland the results are similar i stopped to talk with the critical care physician on duty someone i d known since college i m running a warehouse for the dying she said bleakly of the ten patients in her unit she said only two were likely to leave the hospital for any length of time more typical was an almost eighty year old woman at the end of her life with irreversible congestive heart failure who was in the icu for the second time in three weeks drugged to oblivion and tubed in most natural orifices as well as a few artificial ones in 2008 the national coping with cancer project published a study showing that terminally ill cancer patients who were put on a mechanical ventilator given electrical defibrillation or chest compressions or admitted near death to intensive care had a substantially worse quality of life in their last week than those who received no such interventions and six months after their death their caregivers were three times as likely to suffer major depression the most promising was a pfizer drug that targeted one of the mutations found in her cancer s cells sara and her family instantly pinned their hopes on it the drug was so new that it didn t even have a name just a number pf0231006 and this made it all the more enticing there were a few hovering issues including the fact that the scientists didn t yet know the safe dose the drug was only in a phase i trial that is a trial designed to determine the toxicity of a range of doses not whether the drug worked furthermore a test of the drug against her cancer cells in a petri dish showed no effect but marcoux thought that these were not decisive obstacles just negatives the critical problem was that the rules of the trial excluded sara because of the pulmonary embolism she had developed that summer i spoke to susan block a palliative care specialist at my hospital who has had thousands of these difficult conversations and is a nationally recognized pioneer in training doctors and others in managing end of life issues with patients and their families you have to understand block told me a family meeting is a procedure and it requires no less skill than performing an operation a large part of the task is helping people negotiate the overwhelming anxiety anxiety about death anxiety about suffering anxiety about loved ones anxiety about finances she explained there are many worries and real terrors no one conversation can address them all arriving at an acceptance of one s mortality and a clear understanding of the limits and the possibilities of medicine is a process not an epiphany there is no single way to take people with terminal illness through the process but there are some rules according to block you sit down you make time you re not determining whether they want treatment x versus y you re trying to learn what s most important to them under the circumstances so that you can provide information and advice on the approach that gives them their best chance of achieving it this process requires as much listening as talking if you are talking more than half of the time block says you re talking too much you don t ask what do you want when you are dying you ask if time becomes short what is most important to you a few days later the patient returned to talk to the oncologist there should be something there must be something he said his father had shown him reports of cures on the internet he confided how badly his father was taking the news no patient wants to cause his family pain according to block about two thirds of patients are willing to undergo therapies they don t want if that is what their loved ones want she told the father that he needed to understand time with his son was limited and the young man was going to need his father s help getting through it the oncologist noted wryly how much easier it would have been for her just to prescribe the chemotherapy but that meeting with the father was the turning point she said the patient and the family opted for hospice they had more than a month together before he died later the father thanked the doctor that last month he said the family simply focused on being together and it proved to be the most meaningful time they d ever spent still unresolved argument about what the function of medicine really is what in other words we should and should not be paying for doctors to do the simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease and that is of course its most basic task death is the enemy but the enemy has superior forces eventually it wins and in a war that you cannot win you don t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation you don t want custer you want robert e lee someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can t someone who understands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter end more often these days medicine seems to supply neither custers nor lees we are increasingly the generals who march the soldiers onward saying all the while you let me know when you want to stop all out treatment we tell the incurably ill is a train you can get off at any time just say when but for most patients and their families we are asking too much they remain riven by doubt and fear and desperation some are deluded by a fantasy of what medical science can achieve our responsibility in medicine is to deal with human beings as they are people die only once they have no experience to draw on they need doctors and nurses who are willing to have the hard discussions and say what they have seen benzel had a way of looking at people that let them know he was really looking at them he was several inches taller than my parents but he made sure to sit at eye level he turned his seat away from the computer and planted himself directly in front of them he did not twitch or fidget or even react when my father talked he had that midwesterner s habit of waiting a beat after people have spoken before speaking himself in order to see if they are really done he had small dark eyes set behind wire rim glasses and a mouth hidden by the thick gray bristle of a van dyke beard the only thing to hint at what he was thinking was the wrinkle of his glossy dome of a forehead eventually he steered the conversation back to the central issue the tumor was worrisome but he now understood something about my father s concerns he believed my father had time to wait and see how quickly his symptoms changed he could hold off surgery in the end benzel was also the one who proved right as time passed my father noticed no change in symptoms he decided to put off the follow up appointment it was ultimately a year before he returned to see benzel a repeat mri showed the tumor had enlarged yet physical examination found no diminishment in my dad s strength sensation or mobility third type of doctor patient relationship which they called interpretive here the doctor s role is to help patients determine what they want interpretive doctors ask what is most important to you what are your worries then when they know your answers they tell you about the red pill and the blue pill and which one would most help you achieve your priorities experts have come to call this shared decision making it seemed to us medical students a nice way to work with patients as physicians but it seemed almost entirely theoretical certainly to the larger medical community the idea that most doctors would play this kind of role for patients seemed far fetched at the time surgeons interpretive ha but it s the meaning behind the information that people are looking for more than the facts the best way to convey meaning is to tell people what the information means to you yourself he said and he gave me three words to use to do that i am worried i told douglass the tumor was still there i explained and i was worried the blockage was likely to come back they were such simple words but it wasn t hard to sense how much they communicated i had given her the facts but by including the fact that i was worried i d not only told her about the seriousness of the situation i d told her that i was on her side i was pulling for her the words also told her that although i feared something serious there remained uncertainties possibilities for hope within the parameters nature had imposed i let her and her family take in what i d said i don t remember douglass s precise words when she spoke but i remember that the weather in the room had changed clouds rolled in she wanted more information i asked her what she wanted to know this was another practiced and deliberate question on my part i felt foolish to still be learning how to talk to people at this stage of my career but arnold had also recommended a strategy palliative care physicians use when they have to talk about bad news with people they ask tell ask they ask what you want to hear then they tell you and then they ask what you understood so i asked she was starting to grasp that this is what the closing phase of a modern life often looks like a mounting series of crises from which medicine can offer only brief and temporary rescue she was experiencing what i have come to think of as the odtaa syndrome the syndrome of one damn thing after another it does not have a totally predictable path the pauses between crises can vary but after a certain point the direction of travel becomes clear i distinctly remember the feeling that a crisis was creeping up on us he was becoming quadriplegic is it time for surgery i asked him i don t know he said it was time i realized for our own hard conversation i m worried i said i recalled the list of questions susan block the palliative medicine expert had said mattered most and posed them to my father one by one i asked him what his understanding was of what was happening to him he understood what i understood he was becoming paralyzed he said what were his fears if that should happen i asked he said he feared that he would become a burden on my mother and that he wouldn t be able to take care of himself anymore he couldn t fathom what his life would become my mother tearing said she would be there for him she would be happy to take care of him already the shift had started he was having her do more and more of the driving and she arranged his medical appointments now he also complied with the instructions not to attempt to get around without help the hospice helped my parents hire a personal care aide to stay overnight and assist my father to the bathroom when he needed it after that he had no more falls and we gradually realized how much each one had set him back every passing day without a fall allowed his back and neck spasms to reduce his pain to become better controlled and his strength to increase technological society has forgotten what scholars call the dying role and its importance to people as life approaches its end people want to share memories pass on wisdoms and keepsakes settle relationships establish their legacies make peace with god and ensure that those who are left behind will be okay they want to end their stories on their own terms this role is observers argue among life s most important for both the dying and those left behind and if it is the way we deny people this role out of obtuseness and neglect is cause for everlasting shame we in medicine inflict deep gouges at the end of people s lives and then stand oblivious to the harm done during the first couple days of august i received a series of garbled e mails dear atuli whohirnd li9ke sude began one the last one said dear atul sorry for scrambeled letth ter i having problems with love dad we ve been wrong about what our job is in medicine we think our job is to ensure health and survival but really it is larger than that it is to enable well being and well being is about the reasons one wishes to be alive
