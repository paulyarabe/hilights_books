he wanted to know if there were lots of tiny universes dotted around i told him never to be afraid to come up with an idea or a hypothesis no matter how daft his words not mine it might seem you can t get to a time before the big bang because there was no time before the big bang we have finally found something that doesn t have a cause because there was no time for a cause to exist in for me this means that there is no possibility of a creator because there is no time for a creator to have existed in i think belief in an afterlife is just wishful thinking there is no reliable evidence for it and it flies in the face of everything we know in science i think that when we die we return to dust but there s a sense in which we live on in our influence and in our genes that we pass on to our children we have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe and for that i am extremely grateful we are more than just our genes we may be no stronger or inherently more intelligent than our caveman ancestors but what distinguishes us from them is the knowledge that we have accumulated over the last 10 000 years and particularly over the last 300 i think it is legitimate to take a broader view and include externally transmitted information as well as dna in the evolution of the human race other qualities such as intelligence are probably controlled by a large number of genes and it will be much more difficult to find them and work out the relations between them nevertheless i am sure that during this century people will discover how to modify both intelligence and instincts like aggression laws will probably be passed against genetic engineering with humans but some people won t be able to resist the temptation to improve human characteristics such as size of memory resistance to disease and length of life once such superhumans appear there are going to be major political problems with the unimproved humans who won t be able to compete in science fiction space and time warps are commonplace they are used for rapid journeys around the galaxy or for travel through time but today s science fiction is often tomorrow s science fact the leverhulme centre for the future of intelligence is a multi disciplinary institute dedicated to researching the future of intelligence as crucial to the future of our civilisation and our species we spend a great deal of time studying history which let s face it is mostly the history of stupidity so it s a welcome change that people are studying instead the future of intelligence we are aware of the potential dangers but perhaps with the tools of this new technological revolution we will even be able to undo some of the damage done to the natural world by industrialisation when i think about ingenuity einstein springs to mind where did his ingenious ideas come from a blend of qualities perhaps intuition originality brilliance einstein had the ability to look beyond the surface to reveal the underlying structure he was undaunted by common sense the idea that things must be the way they seemed he had the courage to pursue ideas that seemed absurd to others and this set him free to be ingenious a genius of his time and every other the human mind is an incredible thing it can conceive of the magnificence of the heavens and the intricacies of the basic components of matter yet for each mind to achieve its full potential it needs a spark the spark of enquiry and wonder often that spark comes from a teacher allow me to explain i wasn t the easiest person to teach i was slow to learn to read and my handwriting was untidy but when i was fourteen my teacher at my school in st albans dikran tahta showed me how to harness my energy and encouraged me to think creatively about mathematics he opened my eyes to maths as the blueprint of the universe itself if you look behind every exceptional person there is an exceptional teacher when each of us thinks about what we can do in life chances are we can do it because of a teacher i believe the future of learning and education is the internet people can answer back and interact in a way the internet connects us all together like the neurons in a giant brain i am advocating that all young people should be familiar with and confident around scientific subjects whatever they choose to do they need to be scientifically literate and inspired to engage with developments in science and technology in order to learn more so remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist be curious and however difficult life may seem there is always something you can do and succeed at it matters that you don t just give up unleash your imagination shape the future
