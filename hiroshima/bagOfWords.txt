under many houses people screamed for help but no one helped in general survivors that day assisted only their relatives or immediate neighbours for they could not comprehend or tolerate a wider circle of misery patients were dying by the hundreds but there was nobody to carry away the corpses some of the hospital staff distributed biscuits and rice balls but the charnel house smell was so strong that few were hungry by three o clock the next morning after nineteen straight hours of his gruesome work dr sasaki was incapable of dressing another wound he and some other survivors of the hospital staff got straw mats and went outdoors thousands of patients and hundreds of dead were in the yard and on the driveway and hurried around behind the hospital and lay down in hiding to snatch some sleep but within an hour wounded people had found them a complaining circle formed around them doctors help us how can you sleep dr sasaki got up again and went back to work early in the day he thought for the first time of his mother at their country home in mukaihara thirty miles from town he usually went home every night he was afraid she would think he was dead mr tanimoto was still angry at doctors he decided that he would personally bring one to asano park by the scruff of the neck if necessary he crossed the river went past the shinto shrine where he had met his wife for a brief moment the day before and walked to the east parade ground since this had long before been designated as an evacuation area he thought he would find an aid station there he did find one operated by an army medical unit but he also saw that its doctors were hopelessly overburdened with thousands of patients sprawled among corpses across the field in front of it nevertheless he went up to one of the army doctors and said as reproachfully as he could why have you not come to asano park you are badly needed there without even looking up from his work the doctor said in a tired voice this is my station but there are many dying on the riverbank over there the first duty the doctor said is to take care of the slightly wounded why when there are many who are heavily wounded on the riverbank the doctor moved to another patient in an emergency like this he said as if he were reciting from a manual the first task is to help as many as possible to save as many lives as possible there is no hope for the heavily wounded they will die we can t bother with them that may be right from a medical standpoint mr tanimoto began but then he looked out across the field where the many dead lay close and intimate with those who were still living and he turned away without finishing his sentence angry now with himself he didn t know what to do he had promised some of the dying people in the park that he would bring them medical aid they might die feeling cheated he saw a ration stand at one side of the field and he went to it and begged some rice cakes and biscuits and he took them back in lieu of doctors to the people in the park he heard a voice ask from the underbrush have you anything to drink he saw a uniform thinking there was just one soldier he approached with the water when he had penetrated the bushes he saw there were about twenty men and they were all in exactly the same nightmarish state their faces were wholly burned their eyesockets were hollow the fluid from their melted eyes had run down their cheeks they must have had their faces upturned when the bomb went off perhaps they were anti aircraft personnel their mouths were mere swollen pus covered wounds which they could not bear to stretch enough to admit the spout of the teapot so father kleinsorge got a large piece of grass and drew out the stem so as to make a straw and gave them all water to drink that way one of them said i can t see anything father kleinsorge answered as cheerfully as he could there s a doctor at the entrance to the park he s busy now but he ll come soon and fix your eyes i hope there set a loudspeaker in the ruins of the station many civilians all of them were in boundage some being helped by shoulder of their daughters some sustaining their injured feet by sticks they listened to the broadcast and when they came to realize the fact that it was the emperor they cried with full tears in their eyes what a wonderful blessing it is that tenno himself call on us and we can hear his own voice in person we are thoroughly satisfied in such a great sacrifice when they came to know the war was ended that is japan was defeated they of course were deeply disappointed but followed after their emperor s commandment in calm spirit making wholehearted sacrifice for the everlasting peace of the world and japan started her new way
