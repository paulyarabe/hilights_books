gathering the conscious bringing together of people for a reason shapes the way we think feel and make sense of our world lawgivers have understood perhaps as well as anyone the power inherent in gatherings in democracies the freedom to assemble is one of the foundational rights granted to every individual in countries descending into authoritarianism one of the first things to go is the right to assemble why because of what can happen when people come together exchange information inspire one another test out new ways of being together and yet most of us spend very little time thinking about the actual ways in which we gather we don t even seem to be thrilled with the time we spend with our friends a 2013 study the state of friendship in america 2013 a crisis of confidence found that 75 percent of respondents were unsatisfied with those relationships meanwhile in how we gather a recent report on the spiritual life of young people angie thurston and casper ter kuile write as traditional religion struggles to attract young people millennials are looking elsewhere with increasing urgency as much as our gatherings disappoint us though we tend to keep gathering in the same tired ways most of us remain on autopilot when we bring people together following stale formulas hoping that the chemistry of a good meeting conference or party will somehow take care of itself that thrilling results will magically emerge from the usual staid inputs it is almost always a vain hope i discovered that field in college when i became interested in and anguished by the state of race relations at the university of virginia upon graduating i worked in communities in the united states and abroad to train leaders in a group dialogue process called sustained dialogue it is a gathering technique that aims to transform fractured relationships across racial ethnic and religious lines through that work i became fascinated with what occurs when people attempt to come together across difference gatherings crackle and flourish when real thought goes into them when often invisible structure is baked into them and when a host has the curiosity willingness and generosity of spirit to try you are not alone if you skip the first step in convening people meaningfully committing to a bold sharp purpose and yet at moments when we could benefit from gathering to determine how to make a neighborhood park safe again to strategize with a friend and think through ways to help her struggling career to rebuild focus after a particularly brutal sales cycle we don t think to gather or are too busy to or in the modern way we don t want to ask people for their time so widespread is this desire not to impose that a growing number of people report not wanting any funeral at all when they die for example in planning that networking night what if the organizers paused to ask questions like these is our purpose for this gathering to help people find business partners or clients is the purpose to help guests sell their wares or to get advice on the weaker parts of their product is the purpose of the night to help as many people from different fields make as many new connections as possible or to build a tribe that would want to meet again the answers to these questions should lead to very different formats of an evening like all repeated gatherings the justice center is a work in progress the participants berman said are constantly making sure that we are remaining true to our mission this is supposed to be a laboratory and a model it s supposed to be a different way of doing things and a better way of doing things thinking of the place as a laboratory frees the people at the justice center to be great gatherers there are no lines in our head about how we should gather or what it needs to look like berman told me every case and every client is looked at individually this attitude allows them to separate their assumptions of what a court proceeding should look like from what a proceeding could look like zoom out if she doesn t zoom out a chemistry teacher might tell herself that her purpose is to teach chemistry while teaching is a noble undertaking this definition does not give her much guidance on how to actually design her classroom experience if instead she decides that her purpose is to give the young a lifelong relationship to the organic world new possibilities emerge the first step to a more scintillating classroom begins with that zooming out this focus on the outcome may sound obvious in a business context but strange when getting together with friends and family yet working backward from an outcome can be helpful in personal settings too even outside of work you are proposing to consume people s most precious resource time making the effort to consider how you want your guests and yourself to be altered by the experience is what you owe people as a good steward of that resource you don t have to make a big announcement about this desired outcome it s just something that might help you become clearer on why you are gathering a thanksgiving dinner animated by a purpose of getting difficult issues out in the open to break an impasse between family members is very different from a thanksgiving dinner oriented toward levity after a grueling and stressful year knowing what you want to happen can help you make the choices to get there you will have begun to gather with purpose when you learn to exclude with purpose when you learn to close doors even when you get clear on your gathering in this way there is never an easy way to say please don t come that s why so many of our gatherings end up being hijacked in the name of politeness but here is what the skilled gatherer must know in trying not to offend you fail to protect the gathering itself and the people in it i have learned that far too often in the name of inclusion and generosity two values i care about deeply we fail to draw boundaries about who belongs and why it took me time to see the compassionate potential of the closed door diversity is a potentiality that needs to be activated it can be used or it can just be there consider the case of judson manor a retirement community in ohio that has limited its membership to two distinct tightly bounded populations college music students and retirees this twist on a home for the elderly occupies a revamped 1920s hotel in 2010 what was then your standard issue retirement community decided to try an experiment after a board member heard of a housing shortage at the nearby cleveland institute of music it invited 2 and eventually 5 music students from the school to live with its 120 elderly residents rent free in exchange for giving recitals and art therapy courses and spending time with residents organizers hoped the music students would serve as a tonic against isolation dementia and even high blood pressure the idea was rooted in studies that show huge health benefits for the elderly when they interact with young people the students would in turn receive what every artist dreams of an eager captive audience and what everyone else dreams of free housing these intergenerational housing experiments have also been tried in the netherlands to much fanfare excluding thoughtfully allows you to focus on a specific underexplored relationship the tightly bound program transformed it from a service program into a relationship between young artists and aging ears groups of 6 groups of this rough size are wonderfully conducive to intimacy high levels of sharing and discussion through storytelling the young presidents organization a network for ceo types has developed a highly structured process that helps peers in groups of 6 thoughtfully coach one another through their problems groups of 6 are on the other hand not ideal for diversity of viewpoints and they cannot bear much dead weight to make the gathering great there s more responsibility on each person groups of 12 to 15 the next interesting number is around 12 twelve is small enough to build trust and intimacy and small enough for a single moderator if there is one formal or informal to handle when multiple facilitators are required at a large meeting it is customary to divide the number of participants by 12 to figure out how many facilitators are needed at the same time 12 is large enough to offer a diversity of opinion and large enough that it allows for a certain quotient of mystery and intrigue of constructive unfamiliarity to paraphrase and distort winston churchill first you determine your venue and then your venue determines which you gets to show up if figuring out the guest list is about deciding who best helps you fulfill the purpose of your gathering figuring out the venue is about deciding how you want to nudge those chosen few to be the fullest versions of themselves and the best guests the reason i do this is to challenge traditional hierarchies of teaching and learning the design of social space physical space and emotional space affects how people engage with ideas content and each other and i wanted to show my students that you must actually design a space for exchange and also then invite participation by design
