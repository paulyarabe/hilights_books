today medicine is just another profession and doctors have become like everybody else insecure discontented and anxious about the future in surveys a majority of doctors express diminished enthusiasm for medicine and say they would discourage a friend or family member from entering the profession in a 2008 survey of twelve thousand physicians only 6 percent described their morale as positive eighty four percent said their incomes were constant or decreasing the majority said they did not have enough time to spend with patients because of paperwork and nearly half said they planned to reduce the number of patients they would see in the next three years or stop practicing altogether american doctors are suffering from a collective malaise we strove made sacrifices and for what for many the job has become only that a job c insensitivity in patient doctor interactions has become almost normal by the time patients get to me they have already seen their internist and cardiologist they have had their echos and caths still i feel an obligation to examine them when i listen to their hearts i make sure to put my hand on their shoulder to convey a sense of warmth i think it is enormously important to touch patients before i cut into them a big problem was a lack of health literacy patients not knowing that they needed to eliminate salt from their diets or take their medications regularly for example which was due in no small part to inadequate teaching on the part of their care providers a typical complaint from patients was that their doctors had told them they had weak hearts but never told them why i spent two weeks in the hospital but no one ever talked to me about it one patient told me they never said this is what is happening this is what you can expect in fact no one ever talked to me about it until now who hugs you doctor i laughed no one the sheer arduousness of taking care of a newborn had sapped the romantic energy at home don t look at me john quickly interjected i ll give you a hug she said embarrassed i shook my head no that s all right no it s not all right come here give me a hug she struggled to sit up swaying from side to side to pull up her three hundred or so pounds then she grabbed hold of me if you get fifteen hugs a day all your problems will be solved i wish it were that easy i said as she squeezed the air out of me no i m serious she said a hug does something to your inside no question about that i thought feeling my spleen being crushed another doctor wrote the whole apologize and hope it goes away thing is such a phony myth perpetuated by ethics types who don t have to worry about career ruin in the lawyer gang bang that is u s health care and another wrote it s like confessing an extramarital affair to your spouse what do you expect to accomplish however studies have shown that physicians apologies do not necessarily increase malpractice lawsuits in fact they might protect against litigation in surveys patients say they desire acknowledgment of even minor errors for both moderate and severe mistakes patients are significantly more likely to sue if a physician does not disclose the error a fact most doctors are unaware of there has been a trend toward such apologies twenty nine states have enacted legislation encouraging them some even making physicians expressions of remorse inadmissible in court a lawyer for the hospital said that at some point in our careers every one of us would likely be sued and that we could even be sued during residency she offered some advice document your decision making document when a patient refuses treatment never admit wrongdoing never talk to an opposing attorney and finally be nice to your patients doctors who were nice to their patients were rarely sued even in cases of egregious malpractice the story of this patient is one we encountered almost every day my first year at lij a heart attack victim taken by ambulance to a community hospital that isn t equipped to perform angioplasty if the man had been brought to lij which has cardiac catheterization available twenty four hours a day the damage to his heart could have been averted adding years to his life but it would have required a degree of coordination and oversight that many ambulance fleets in new york and across the country lack we discussed many such cases at hospital meetings on how to shorten door to balloon d2b time the time between hospital arrival and balloon angioplasty for patients having heart attacks in 1971 eugene braunwald a cardiologist at harvard medical school proposed a radical hypothesis time is muscle he postulated that acute myocardial infarction is a dynamic process and that cardiac injury could be reduced by expeditious intervention many studies since then have demonstrated that shorter d2b time is strongly associated with survival more important patients don t always require specialists patients often have overlap syndromes we used to call it aging which cannot be compartmentalized into individual problems and are probably best managed by a good general physician when specialists are called in they are apt to view each problem through the lens of their specific organ expertise perhaps the hardest thing in medicine is to do nothing especially when you re called for help patients generally end up worse off i have seen it over and over again referrals are probably unnecessary and there is plenty of evidence that wasteful expert consultation is adding to health costs and creating redundant care but as a full fledged doctor i appreciate the business it is hard not to view a referral as an overture from another physician and it is equally hard not to return the favor however referrals can put you into a moral bind should you refer patients back to certain doctors not necessarily the best doctors sometimes even assholes who aren t particularly good with their patients just to sustain your business it is a paradox of specialized medicine specialists are better paid than primary care physicians but they are also less autonomous because unlike primary care physicians they depend on other doctors for referrals so there is tremendous pressure on specialists to keep referral sources happy especially in doctor saturated areas like long island my parents were supposed to fly out the following day i felt a vague longing for them to stay my heart ached when i remembered how dad used to return from research conferences with a bag of airplane peanuts or a couple of brach s candies for his kids i wasn t sure why i was crying in human physiology there is the concept of referred pain in which a painful sensation is perceived to be in a different place from where the injury actually has occurred and so it is with emotions too it wasn t just about my job or financial frustrations but something else my relationship with my father how he was with me or perhaps just how he was he had been so detached while i was growing up i had always been desperate for his approval now that we have come up with a plan don t rehash everything keep yourself busy an idle brain is the devil s workshop so keep as busy as possible and when you go to work work the job has to be your first priority and move to long island to be closer to your job go after exactly what you want not what you want for you never get anything but the things that you exactly wanted alan gregg twentieth century physician 1867 the aetna guide to fire insurance introduced the concept of moral hazard into actuarial science the publication warned that generous insurance policies could make some people careless about preventing fires protected in part from the consequences of their actions those people were more likely to engage in risky behavior like not clearing their yards of brush or leaving their houses without adequate ventilation the guide made a revolutionary and counterintuitive point insurance in some cases can increase risk moral hazard undoubtedly plays a role in health care too when people complain that their rising insurance premiums are funding others irresponsible behavior they are complaining about moral hazard my doc of the day patients were often frustrating to manage and not just because of the volume a big reason was their limited resources they rarely saw a doctor regularly and poverty and lack of health insurance or social support were constant stressors in their lives a social worker on one of my cases told me that for most patients domestic problems or destructive habits were entrenched there was little that could be done for them in the hospital and patients were often lost to follow up after discharge she did the best she could but there was only so much that could be done though she was trained as a clinical psychologist most of her work revolved around mundane issues like insurance forms and discharge planning i smiled at john s gravity but he was right of course we so often waste our borrowed time i had seen so much death the past four years seen so many patients come and go a few weeks prior when i had been in line at the hospital deli to buy an iced coffee a woman in front of me paid for her drink picked up a laptop computer and a sheaf of papers and turned to me in my white coat and said he s probably dead by now my husband and walked out the single greatest problem in medicine today is the disrespect of time one cannot do anything in medicine well on the fly so racing through patient encounters you practice with an ever present fear that you will miss something hurt someone and open yourself up to legal not to mention moral liability to cope with the anxiety you start to call in experts for problems that perhaps you could have handled yourself if you had had more time to think through the case apart from the perverse incentives of our fee for service system a major driver of overconsultation is the uncertainty engendered by the hurried pace of contemporary medicine there are many things doctors could do to reduce hospital readmission rates they could ensure that discharged patients get timely follow up appointments in the new england journal study half of all medical patients readmitted within thirty days had not visited a doctor after discharge they could do a better job of ensuring that patients obtained their medications and understood how to take them when i was a fellow one of my elderly patients bounced back to the hospital simply because she d missed her morning dose of diuretic on the day after discharge though i d given her prescriptions and gone over the dosing schedule i hadn t checked whether there was someone available to drive to the pharmacy to get her medications an oversight that resulted in a 10 000 rehospitalization doctors could also do a better job of educating patients about which symptoms and signs presage worsening of their disease shortness of breath and leg swelling in congestive heart failure for example we know that patients with a clear understanding of discharge instructions are 30 percent less likely to return to the hospital but research shows inconsistency at best in achieving these goals after so many years in medicine i am convinced of one thing the vast majority of doctors aren t bad it is the system that makes us bad makes us make mistakes most doctors and this is certainly true of my colleagues at the hospital are willing to stay late and work hard to provide good care but they are struggling to do so in a system that is diseased as is so often the case in our health care system doctors incentives do not serve broader social goals this virtually guarantees that proposed reforms like cutting readmissions reducing unnecessary testing and adopting computerized medical records will fail the agency that runs medicare is considering giving bonuses to hospitals that lower readmissions below the average though i think it s a good idea i believe some of this money should be shared with doctors current law prohibits hospitals from paying doctors for reducing hospital services even if the goal is to provide more efficient care but such gainsharing will align physicians incentives with cost cutting goals our system structured to encourage overutilization needs to provide some inducements to reduce the amount of health care too work out what things in life you care about the beliefs you hold near and dear and stick to them the past four years at lij had been such a turbulent time both professionally and personally i d been so occupied with the heavy lifting of establishing my career that i hadn t given much thought to my value system or to the kind of doctor and i don t mean specialist that i wanted to be in surveys most physicians even the dissatisfied ones say the best part of their jobs is taking care of people i believe this is the key to coping with the stresses of contemporary medicine identifying what is important to you what you believe in and what you will fight for for me i ve learned it s the human moments such as the house call with hyman gesselman the human moments are what others the lawyers the bankers envy about our profession and no company no agency no entity can take those away
